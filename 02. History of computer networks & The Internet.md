##  Evolution of Internet started with Memex, a conceptual device in 1945 used for storing and retrieving data. This concept was later used as a guideline for creating the Internet. 

## In 1948 Claude Shannon, MIT mathematician wrote a paper titled Mathematical Theory of Communication which determined how one can measure the amount of information in a message and how to transfer it on a noisy channel for e.g. a telephone wire with the least amount of errors. He also introduced the concept of information entropy, i.e. the measure of uncertainty in a message. He also introduced the term 'bit'  in his article. Likewise, he is known as the father of information theory. 

## ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network) developed by ARPA(subset of US department of defense) was the first Wide Area Network (WAN) computer network that used packet switching, it is the technology that became the foundation of the internet. The first ARPANET computers were connected in 1969. ARPANET was the first network to used TCP IP protocol to communicate 


## TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol & IP stands for Internet Protocol. Data/Information is broken down into small parts sent across many different routes over a network. TCP is the component responsible for reassembling those data packets, whereas IP is used to determine which device that message is sent to.

## Packet Switching, also used in ARPANET, was invented in 1964. The whole process of data being broken down into small packets, being sent through different routes and being assembled at the end point as explained in the last paragraph, is called Packet Switching.

## Hypertext, the concept of linking content and media ('Hypermedia') was developed in 1963 by Ted Nelson but his first incomplete public release was in 1998.

## Ethernet was developed by XEROX in 1973 and the open Ethernet standard was standardized by 1983. The first Ethernet network used coaxial cables, enabling the speed of up to 2.9 Mbits/s. 

## First Local Area Network was used by colleges and universities in the 60s. The first commercial uses of LAN was Chase Manhattan Bank in New York in 1977. 

## Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which is a service like email or Usenet, it used the Concept of Hypertext and packet switching via TCP/IP protocol, he also developed the first web server and a web browser and a document formatting protocol HTML (HyperText Markup Language) in 1991. He later released the source code for his browser for public use in 1993. Websites for public use started emerging in 1994.

## Following the complete removal of commercial restrictions on internet use by 1995, commercialization of the internet led to the dot com boom in the late 90s and early 2000s.
