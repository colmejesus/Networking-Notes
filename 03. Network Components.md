## Hosts:
### All computers connected to a network, that participate in a network communication, are called Hosts also known as end devices. 

## IP Address: 
### It is the number that uniquely identifies hosts and the network to which they hosts are attached.

## Servers: 
## Servers are the computers which run specialized software that allows them to provide information like web pages, email videos for streaming etc. to other end devices on a network. 

## A computer with a server software can provide services to multiple clients, simultaneously


### Example Of Client Server Model

# Types Of Server:

## E-mail Server: Servers run email server software to provide email services to client computers, which can access email using client software such as Microsoft Outlook.

## Web Server: They provide internet services to clients using web server software. Clients can access web pages on client software called web browsers. 

## File sharing: Servers can store files in a central location for sharing and clients can access/retrieve those files using specialized software which can either be installed on or comes pre-installed on the operating system for e.g. File Explorer on Windows, or they can also run as a web app on a browser for example Dropbox or Google Drive. 

## Intermediary Devices:

## Intermediary devices are the devices that facilitate the communication between hosts/end devices in a network. They connect multiple hosts/end devices to form a network. 

## Intermediary devices use unique identifiers i.e. mac addresses along with the information about the network interconnection to determine the best possible route to transmit information in a network. Examples of intermediary devices are: Switches, router, Wi-Fi access points, firewall appliances etc. 

## Network media: 

## Network media are the channels which are used by the intermediary devices to connect to end devices in a network. 

## Modern networks primarily use three kinds of network media to facilitate the transfer of information:

### 1. Metal Wires: Data is encoded in the form of electrical impulses to facilitate communication, copper is used. 

### 2. Fiber Optics Cables: Data is encoded in the form of pulses of light, much faster than metal wires.

### 3. Wireless Transmission: Data is encoded by modulating the frequency of electromagnetic waves, Wi-Fi is an example of wireless transmission, less safethan last to mediums.
