## In a Peer to Peer network, all the computers present in a network can act both as client and server. Unlike the client server model, there is no central authority that is controlling the behavior of other client devices on the network, i.e. there is no specialized server software running on one single computer. It is up to the individual client to decide if they want to share the access of files or resources like printer to all the other clients. The initial use of peer to peer network started in the 80s.

### Client Server Architecture VS Peer To Peer Architecture:

## Pros and Cons Of Peer To Peer Architecture: 

## Pros:

### Easier to set up, no need of a specialized server, which saves overhead costs.

### Since it is not centralized, one computer not working does not disrupt the operations of other computers.

### Inexpensive compared to Client-Server model. 

### No need of specialized network admin since all hosts are given the rights to what files they can let other hosts access. 

### Cons:

#### 1. Not as secure as Client-Server model. P2P networks are more prone to malware attack due to decentralization as keeping the computers safe by implementing firewalls and antivirus software falls into the hand of every individual user that is a part of the network, hence difficult to manage. 

#### 2. Since the host computers in this network act as both client and server, it affects the individual speed of a host. 

#### 3. Decentralization makes it difficult to find and retrieve files since they are stored across multiple computers. 

#### 4. Also, due to decentralization, backup systems are difficult to implement on all hosts on a network.
