### Network representation help network admins determine how hosts and intermediary devices are connected to each other in any network, they also help network admins determine the physical location of all the devices in an organization, since a big organization can have multiple servers, intermediary devices taking up a lot of space hence it is easy to map them out in network representations in order for admins to troubleshoot if there are some issues in the network. The picture which help visually represent a network with all the symbols that represent all the devices in a network is often called topology diagram. 

#### Example of a Topology Diagram:

### Network representation often use symbols to represent various hosts, intermediary devices and mediums that make up the network.

## Some important terms used in a topology diagram:

### NIC : Network Interface Card, is a hardware component used to connect end devices to a computer network. 

### Physical Ports: They are the physical connectors in network devices where communication ends or begins, they are used to connect network devices to each other. They also perform basic processing such as reading the transmitted data, for e.g. Ethernet port, LAN ports.

## Type of topology diagrams:

### There are two types of topology diagrams:

#### 1. Physical Topology Diagram: It identifies the physical location of network components in an organization, making it easier for network admins to find a specific component, like a server or a switch. Since data centers that host these components have a lot of multiple components in the same building, so it will be very difficult to find a particular component if it malfunctions. 


#### Example of a Physical Topological Diagram:

#### 2. Logical Topological Diagram

### It specifies how information in a computer network flows, it helps **'visualize and identify'** components like subnets (IP addresses, VLAN IDs), network components like router & firewalls, routing Domains, routing protocols, traffic flow etc. in a network.

### Logical Topological Diagram help with various aspects of a computer network like troubleshooting (helping identify faulty equipment), identifying network components that are no longer needed, they also help with scaling a computer network by helping plan capacity. 

### Here's an example of a logical topological diagram:
