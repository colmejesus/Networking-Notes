## Addresses in TCP/IP model

## There are 4 kinds of addresses in TCP/IP model:

IP Address: IP addresses are unique address given to an end device on a network which helps in it to connect to a network and communicate with another similar device for e.g. Computers, mobile phones, routers and modems, printers, Network-Attached Storage etc. are all end devices with their unique IP addressed within the same network. It is possible for two different networks to have a device with the same IP address. This is because IP addresses are only unique within a single network, not globally. Each network can have its own range of IP addresses, and as long as two devices have different IP addresses within their own network, there is no conflict.

MAC Address: Media Access Control address, refers to the unique address given to a Network Interface which helps in connecting end devices to the network via network media (Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi). MAC addresses are used to ensure that the data is transmitted to the correct device in a network by uniquely identifying an end device.

Port Number: Port numbers are needed to allow multiple applications on an end device to share the same IP. Without port numbers, it would be difficult to identify which application should receive the data transmitted to an IP address. In TCP/IP model, certain port number are reserved for specific applications. These are known as application-specific addresses. Here are some of them:

1. Port 80: Reserved for HTTP, web browsing application.
2. Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) Reserved for remote access
3. Port 25: Reserved for SMTP, for email transmission. 

Domain name: Is a human-readable address that is used to refer to a website or other resources on the internet, since remembering of IP address, MAC address and port number can be difficult. Domain addresses are resolved to their corresponding IP address using a service called DNS (Domain Name System).


Encapsulation of Data at Each Layer of TCP/IP model:

Encapsulation in context of networking is adding some extra information to the data that is being encapsulated. 

Encapsulation occurs from the sender's side, each layer adds information to the data that eventually helps with its transmission.

1. Application Layer: The application layer is responsible for the encoding of data
