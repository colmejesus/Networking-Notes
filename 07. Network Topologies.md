## Network topologies describe how end devices or nodes and other network components are connected to each other in a network.

## There are multiple types of network topologies, and all of them have their advantages and disadvantages. Here's a list of them:

### 1. Bus Topology: In bus topology, all the computers/nodes are connected with each other through a single cable, known as 'backbone cable'. 

#### Disadvantages: 

##### 1. When a message is sent over the network by one node to another node, it will be received by all nodes connected to the backbone cable.

##### 2. Requires a lot of cabling

##### 3. Signal Interference occurs when nodes send messages simultaneously.

##### 4. Loss of signal, repeaters are often needed to resolve the issue.

##### 5. Adding new devices slows the network down.

#### Advantages:

##### 1. Its configuration is simpler compared to other topologies. 

##### 2. Inexpensive cabling

##### 3. Does not require an intermediary device like hub for networking.

##### 4. Decent data speeds

##### 5. Failure of one node does not affect others. 


#### Here's a pictorial representation:

### 2. Ring Topology: In this topology, each node is connected to two other adjacent nodes on each side, creating a ring shape. Data flow is unidirectional and clockwise, it has no 'terminated ends' i.e. each node is connected to the other node. It uses 'token passing' (computer communicates/sends messages when a token is passed, after communicating it passes the token to the next computer in topology, sort of like passing a mic in among a group of people) as an 'access method' (way for computers to talk to each other, many types of access methods, Token Passing one of them)

### Token along with data and recipient address of node moves around the network until reaches the destination. Token is used as a 'carrier' in Ring Topology. 

#### Advantages: 

##### 1. Faulty devices can be removed from the network without disrupting it. 

##### 2. Reliable since communication is not dependent on one node/computer.

##### 3. Many tools available for monitoring.

##### 4. Inexpensive cabling.

#### Disadvantages: 

##### 1. Adding new nodes slows the network down. 

##### 2. Delay in network, directly proportional to number of nodes in network.

##### 3. Difficulty in troubleshooting since it requires specialized tools. 

##### 4. Breakdown of one node can disrupt the entire network. 


#### Pictorial representation of Ring Topology:

### 3. Star Topology : In Star topology, every node is connected to a central intermediary device like a hub or switch or a central computer which facilitates all communication in the network. A central computer is known as a server, and nodes connected to it are called clients. Most popular topology in network implementation. 


#### Advantages: 

##### 1. Easy scalability since new nodes can be easily added to an open physical port available on the server.

##### 2. Easier Troubleshooting compared to other topologies like Bus, since in Bus topology admin would need to inspect the whole backbone cable which could be very long but in Star Topology they only need to inspect the cable connecting the faulty client to the server hence taking less time to do so. 

##### 3. Failure of one node does not disrupt the entire network. 

##### 4. High Data Speeds compared to other topologies, up to 100 Mbps

##### 5. Cost-effective cabling.

#### Disadvantages:

##### 1. Central point of failure, if the server fails, the entire network is down. 


#### Pictorial representation of Star Topology:

### 4. Mesh Topology: In this topology, every node is either connected to every other node (Full Mesh Topology) or Each node is connected to those nodes it communicates frequently with (Partial Mesh Topology). There are no intermediary devices needed in a 'Full Mesh Topology' whereas in 'Partial Mesh Topology' some nodes may act as intermediary devices since all the nodes are not connected to each other. There are multiple paths nodes can take to communicate with each other, it does not have a central point i.e. a hub or server node like Star Topology. It is used in WAN implementations where communication failures are critical concerns, because as mentioned earlier, having multiple routes of communication helps with communication failures.  Internet has some characteristics of mesh topology, i.e. the ability to use multiple routes to send data. 

#### Advantages:

##### 1. Reliable: If one link breaks down in a network there are often times multiple routes available for data to go through, this characteristic makes sure data reaches its destination.  

##### 2. Fast Communication compared to some other topologies like Bus or Ring topology.

##### 3. Easy reconfiguration: Adding a new node doesn't disrupt the entire network.

#### Disadvantages:

##### 1. Expensive to implement: Since it contains many connected devices for hence the need for intermediary devices like Routers increases, increasing cost, and it uses more transmission media (wired and wireless) compared to other topologies.

##### 2. High number of redundant connections sometime reduces the efficiency of the network. 

##### 3. Difficult management due to having a high number of nodes.

### 5.  Tree Topology: It combines the characteristics of Bus and Star Topology, all the nodes in this topology are connected in a hierarchical manner, top nodes are called 'Root nodes' and all the other nodes are 'descendants' of the root node.  There is only once path of communication between nodes in this topology, i.e. data goes from one node to the root node then passes on to the destination node, it can also go through the 'backbone' cable if the destination node is a descendant of another root node in the network. 

#### Advantages: 

#### 1. Useful in sending signals over long distances, i.e. broadband transmission without the signal getting weakened.  

##### 2. Easy Reconfiguration: New nodes can be added without disturbing the entire network. 

##### 3. Error detection is easier compared to other topologies like Ring or Bus.  

##### 4. Failure in one node does not affect the entire network.

#### Disadvantages:

##### 1. High Cost compared to other topologies like bus.

##### 2. Failure in Backbone/Bus cable can cause the entire network to crash.

### 6. Hybrid Topology: A hybrid topology is a combination of two or more basic network topologies (such as star, bus, ring, mesh, etc.) to form a more complex network structure. In a hybrid topology, the network elements are organized in a way that combines the advantages of different topologies while mitigating the disadvantages.

#### Advantages:

##### 1. Scalability: The hybrid topology is flexible and can be easily expanded as the network grows.

##### 2. Reliability: By combining multiple topologies, the hybrid topology provides a high level of fault tolerance, ensuring that the network remains operational even if one component fails.

##### 3. Flexibility: The hybrid topology can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different network segments, making it a versatile solution.

##### 4. Improved Performance: The use of different topologies in different parts of the network can lead to improved performance, as the topology that is best suited for a particular network segment can be utilized.

#### Disadvantages: 

##### 1. Complexity: The hybrid topology is more complex than basic topologies, making it more difficult to set up, maintain and troubleshoot.

##### 2. Cost: The hybrid topology requires more equipment and resources than basic topologies, which can make it more expensive to implement and maintain.

##### 3. Configuration Management: Managing and configuring a hybrid topology can be more difficult and time-consuming, as it involves coordinating multiple topologies and ensuring they work together seamlessly.

#### In conclusion, the hybrid topology is a good option for organizations that require a combination of different topologies to meet their specific network needs, but it comes with a higher level of complexity and cost.
