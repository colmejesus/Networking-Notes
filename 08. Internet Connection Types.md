## Ways in which home and small businesses are connected:

### Although in urban areas, most residential areas and even small organizations use similar methods to connect to the internet, but the way someone connects to the internet may vary depending upon the location or even the internet service provider. Here are some of the most common ways to connect to the internet in modern times:

### Mobile: They are the most common way to connect to the internet for most people in modern times, there are usually two ways to connect to the internet using a mobile device:


#### Cellular Networks: Cellular networks use cell towers/cell sites which are connected to the network by fiber optic cables or microwave links. Through this network of connection, information is passed on to the mobile network. Cell towers use electromagnetic radio waves as a medium to communicate.

#### Wi-Fi: mobile devices can also connect to a Wi-Fi network to access the internet. Wi-Fi devices are connected to a local 'Tier 3' internet service provider, which is connected to the internet through a WAN, managed by a tier 2 ISPs which in turn get the internet service from tier 1 ISPs. Wi-Fi also uses a similar medium, electromagnetic radio waves, as a medium to communicate to end devices. 

##### Side note: Here's how Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Internet service providers work together to form a network we know as the internet, with Tier 1 laying big lines that work as a medium to carry the signal and for a network across continents, and Tier 2 network get to use that network to connect cities and states with the help of Tier 3 Internet service providers who work as local entities that provide internet services on a local 'city' level. Here's a pictorial representation explaining the same:

### Satellites: They are mostly used in rural areas and organizations to access the internet. It works similarly to how an ISP would work, the difference being that ISPs rely on wires as a medium to communicate between end devices, satellite based internet uses the satellites in the earths orbit to transmit the signal from one end device and that signal is transmitted back from the satellite to the other end device or devices it was intended for via a satellite dish receiver, usually placed at your home or office, to receive the signal from satellite that is floating in earth's. Satellite is used due to the fact that many rural areas are difficult to connect to the WAN through wires due to their inaccessibility. Satellite use radio waves to communicate. 

### Since the information from an end device is being beamed into 22,000 miles into the space and beamed back to a receiver down on earth, satellite internet is quite slow compared to a wired connection. However, some private companies like SpaceX owned by Elon Musk are trying to solve the problem by using lower orbit satellites to provide low latency internet to areas that are inaccessible.

### Wired Internet Connection: It is the most common way of connecting end devices in the modern world. End devices are connected via hardwired connections using Ethernet cables or fiber optic cables as a medium to transfer data between devices, intermediary devices like switches and routers are used to connect the devices together using the medium. This is the fastest way to connect end devices together compared to Wi-Fi and other methods mentioned, and also the safest. 


### Although wired connections have the benefit of speed and security, often times costlier to connect end devices this way and take a considerable amount of time and energy to connect devices to the network. It is also, comparatively, difficult to add new users to the network using Ethernet. 

## Business Internet Connections:

### Big Organizations, unlike homes and small businesses require way more bandwidth (the maximum capacity of wired or wireless medium to transmit data over a network) as they have a big network of computers that are accessing the internet to communicating with each other, therefore ISPs provide specialized internet connections to meet the needs of such organizations.

### Leased Line Connection: In leased line connection, ISPs provide a dedicated, private line of connection which connects an organization to the service provider. Leased line connection are faster, safer and more reliable compared to a normal connection. There are two typically types of leased line connection services provided by the ISPs:

#### 1. Site-to-network connectivity

#### 2. Site-to-site connectivity

### Metro Ethernet: It is an Ethernet transport network, which usually uses fiber optic cables to transport data between two sites (organization) which is also called a point-to-point network or between multiple sites, also known as multipoint network, over a metropolitan area (MAN). Metro Ethernet network originated as LAN technology and slowly replaces WAN technology due to its slow speed.

### Business DSL: DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line, DSL uses telephone lines, the same lines used by landlines, as a medium to communicate between end devices. Unlike Ethernet, DSL is extremely slow for communication and should only be used by organizations that don't primarily use technology to operate their business and don't intend to expand in the near future. One of the main reasons to use DSL over cables is affordability.

## Converged Networks:

### Converged networks refer to the integration of different network of communication i.e. network for voice, data, video, into a single network, allowing for efficient communication and cost-effective infrastructure. 

### Before converged networks, traditional communication networks for voice, data and video were separate i.e. 

> Voice networks were used for telephonic communication
> Data networks used for communication between televisions
> Video networks were used for cable TV and video conferencing
 

### It was in the late 90s and early 2000s, advancement in network technology allowed for different mediums used for multiple networks of communication to get merged into a single infrastructure.
