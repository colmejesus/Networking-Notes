## Modern networking technology enables us to have many applications to increase the efficiency of workflows of individuals and  groups working in an organization.

## Network Trends affecting organizations and consumers these days:

### 1. Online Collaboration: There are many applications that help user to collaborate online in a corporate environment. There are many open source free to use and paid tools where a group of people can come together and collaborate real time on projects. Video conferencing application like Google meet and zoom let multiple users to hop on a video call and discuss and make notes which is very beneficiary for group projects enabling real time feedback. Other applications like GitHub codespaces and Google's Colab let user make changes to a code base and push the code and test it real time, also enabling real time feedback if anything go wrong, hence making the workflow faster and more efficient. There are many other multi functional tools that enable instant messaging, sharing videos and photos, sharing their screen so that other people can see what users are working on all real time.

### 2. Cloud Computing: It's a new and emerging technology that enables organizations to store data on remote servers and rent remote infrastructure to make applications and cloud platforms also come with features like auto scalability which allows users to scale resources like servers, firewalls etc., quickly, in real time so that they are only using the resources they need. Before cloud computing organizations needed to invest in the infrastructure like servers, switches, routers etc., upfront and also pay for their management and rent spaces to keep the equipments on the premises which is a costly affair but with the advent of cloud organizations can just rent the infrastructure that is already set up in a remote location and pay for just the resources they need, and they can easily scale up or down as needed depending on up their computational requirements hence cutting down their costs. 

## Network Architectures:

### Network architecture refers to the design of a computer network, it includes both hardware and software that supports a computer network and allows for users to effortlessly share data across a computer network. To put it more simply, network infrastructure refers to all the infrastructure they support a network. Network infrastructure is responsible for the standards and frameworks that can address various network types and solve business problems to improve reliability

## Reliable Network Features in Network Architectures:

### Users expect network infrastructure to be reliable and efficient in day to day operations in an organization. Reliability of a network ensures continuity of service. There are 4 characteristics that ensures the reliability of a network. 

#### 1. Fault Tolerance: Refers to the ability to provide continuity of operations in the presence of faults. It answers the question of how one can limit the impact of a failure by limiting the number of devices that are effected. One solution to the problem can be to introduce redundancy in a network. Redundancy refers to having a communication pathway that has additional links to other end devices so when one pathway fails, the end device can use another pathway to ensure communication.

#### 3. Scalability: Scalability solves the problem of adding additional devices to a network without affecting other device in the network to ensure smooth operation. This is done by distributing the computational load across devices in a network by adding interfaces, which allows for adding multiple device to a network as the interface allows for connecting multiple device, it also enables redundancy by giving multiple paths for the communication to flow though so that when one device fails there are multiple paths data can follow hence not hampering the communication which also helps when we need to add or remove devices from the network hence allowing effortless and better scalability. 

#### 5. Quality Of Service: It refers to the ability of a network to prioritize services, suppose while watching a video online if the video starts buffering the network should be cable to prioritize the video streaming service by reducing the network bandwidth to other services like VIOP (voice over internet protocol) or web services like user requesting web pages to prioritize video streaming 

## Network Security:

### Two main types to be addressed:

#### 1. Network Infrastructure Security: It refers to the physical security of networking device. Physical devices like firewalls prevents the unauthorized access to the server by unauthorized user, hence reducing the risk to the network. Features like password protection also helps with protecting devices like routers from unauthorized uses. 

#### 2. Information Security: Refers to the protection of data that is transmitted over the network by the means of data encryption

## 3 Goals of network security (CIA):

### 1. Confidentiality: This characteristic of a secure network refers to the fact that Only the intended user can access the data

### 2. Integrity: Integrity of a secured network assures that no data is altered during transmission.

### 3. Availability: It assures the timely and reliable access to the data to authorized users by the means of redundancyy and other countermeasures
