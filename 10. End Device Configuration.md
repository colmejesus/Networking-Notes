## All the network devices come with an operating system that helps us to configure them using CLI (Command Line Interface) & GUI (Graphical User Interface)

## Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System) software has different command modes that let us configure them. The different modes are as follows:

### 1. User Exec Mode: It is the default configuration mode when a user logs into a network devices like router and switches, it only allows for execution of basic commands for  monitoring the network and looking at device's status but doesn't allow the user to make any changes. It is also known as the 'exec' mode. The CLI prompt in this mode ends with '>' symbol.
### 2. Privileged Exec Mode: It provides full access to a devices' configuration options to a user. To enter the mode, the user must enter config mode and then enter the 'enable' command. A user in this mode can make changes to the devices' configuration such as creating interfaces, modifying routing protocols, setting passwords etc. The CLI prompt ends with a '#' symbol. The changes made in this mode do not persist through reboots, i.e. the changes are lost once the device is rebooted. This mode is used primarily for troubleshooting before permanently making the changes in the global mode, so that misconfiguration does not affect the network, therefore maintaining some level of control while still being able to execute advanced tasks. 
### 3. Global Exec Mode: Global exec mode allows users to configure network device as they please and make permanent changes to the network unlike privileged mode, for e.g. they can configure access control list, setting hostname, configuring interfaces etc. The user must enter 'configuration terminal' in privileged exec mode to enter this mode. CLI command ends with  ''(config)#''

## There are two other sub configuration modes called:
### 1. Line Configuration Mode: It is a sub-configuration mode of global configuration mode which allows users to configure lines (physical and logical interfaces) used to connect to a device such as a router or switch. In a network device, lines serve as the entry or exit points in a network that a user can configure. Different lines have different properties such as speed (rate of speed at which lines can receive or transmit data), data type (configuring type of data that can be transmitted) and access method (method used to connect to a line for e.g. console cable, SSH `[an encrypted protocol to transmit data]` or TELNET `[unencrypted protocol to transmit data]`

### 2. Interface Configuration Mode: An interface in a networking device is a point of connection between devices such as Ethernet port, Gigabit Ethernet port or a virtual interface such as a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Interface config mode allows use to configure parameters of an interface such as its Encapsulation Type (method used to wrap `[refers to the process of adding information to the header or trailer files in data packets, there files contail info like source and destination address of host devices that are communicating, protocol type, error checking information]` data packets in protocol, different network use different encapsulation type, i.e. the information in header and trailer changes for e.g. Ethernet encapsulation style is used by LAN whereas WAN uses Frame Relay) IP address, subnet mask etc. whereas Line config mode allows user to configure the properties of the line that determine how a user can connect to the device

## Examples of IOS commands:

### 1. enable: command used in user exec mode in order to inter Privileged exec mode.

### 2. disable: command used in privileged exec mode to go back to user exec mode

### 3. config terminal: command is used to enter global config mode from privileged exec mode

### 4. line: command used to enter Line Configuration mode from Global Configuration Mode.

### 5. exit: command used to exit a sub-configuration mode (Line or Interface config mode) and return to the previous mode. 

### 6. end: command used to exit Global Config Mode and 

## Basic IOS command structure:

### Switch prompt is displayed by CISCO CLI when it is ready for a command to be entered, and it indicates the current user mode, in this photo '>' after a switch indicated that the user is in 'user exec mode', in privileged exec mode switch prompt would've looked like 'Switch#' and in Global Config Mode switch prompt would've looked like this Switch(config)#

## Configuring device names:

### Every network device comes with a default router name, however, it is always a good practice to change the router name to something more descriptive in order to easily identify it in case you have many network devices, which is always true in the case of an organization.

### Important guideline for naming hosts:

#### 1. Start with a letter
#### 2. Names should contain no spaces.
#### 3. End with a letter or digit, avoid using special characters like !, @, $  etc.
#### 4. Use only letters, digits and dashes in the name, no special characters.
#### 5. Use less than 64 character in the name. 

## Guidelines for creating a password for host devices:

### Passwords are very important in keeping the network devices protected from unauthorized access. Use of weak passwords that can be easily guessed are the biggest concerns of organizations. Here are some guidelines for creating them:

#### 1. Create passwords that are 8 character long.
#### 2. Use a combination of lower case and uppercase letters, special characters and numbers.
#### 3. Do not use common words like 'password' or your organization's name, as they can be easily guesses.
#### 4. Avoid using the same password for all the devices.

## Configuring passwords:

### When you initially connect to a device, you first need to access Global Config Mode and then enter Line Configuration Mode and set password by entering these lines:

#### Random_Router_Name(config)# configure terminal
#### Random_Router_name(config)# line console 0 
#### Random_Router_name(config-line)# password `<type_password_here>` 
#### Random_Router_name(config-line)# login
#### Random_Router_name(config-line)# end

#### In this example, the "line console 0" command is used to enter the Line Configuration Mode for the console line. The password `<type_your_password_here>` command sets the password for the console line, and the "login" command enables password authentication for the console line.

#### Command to set a stronger 'higher level password' used to protect access to Privileged Exec mode:

#### Random_Router_Name(config)# configure terminal
#### Random_Router_Name(config)# enable secret <`password`>

## VTY Lines:

### VTY (Virtual Teletype) lines are virtual terminal lines in a Cisco networking device used for remote access to the device, VTY lines allow administrators to connect to the device using Telnet or SSH protocol, they allow a secure way to access network devices safely from a remote location to configure and manage the network devices, they also allow multiple people to access the device simultaneously, making it easier for network administrators to collaborate and work together on a device.

#### Here's how you can secure VTY lines: 

#### Random_Router_Name(config)# configure terminal
#### Random_Router_Name(config)# line vty 0 4 
#### Random_Router_Name(config-line)# password `<password>`
#### Random_Router_Name(config-line)# login

##### In this example, the "line vty 0 4" command is used to enter the Line Configuration Mode for the VTY lines 0 to 4. The "password <`password`>" command sets the password for the VTY lines, and the "login" command enables password authentication for the VTY lines.

### Encrypting Passwords:

#### The configuration files like startup-config files and running-config files display most passwords in plain text, which can be a huge security threat as anyone can look at these passwords if they have access to the files.

#### Service password encryption is a feature in Cisco networking devices that can be used to encrypt config files to avoid such security risks.

#### Service password encryption helps to protect the passwords by encrypting them using a one-way encryption algorithm, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access the passwords.

#### The "service password-encryption" command is used to enable service password encryption in a Cisco device. When service password encryption is enabled, the passwords stored in the configuration file are encrypted, and are displayed in the configuration file as an encrypted string.

#### Here is an example of how to enable service password encryption in a Cisco device:

##### Router# configure terminal 
##### Router(config)# service password-encryption

#### In this example, the "configure terminal" command is used to enter the Global Configuration Mode, and the "service password-encryption" command is used to enable service password encryption.

## Declaring Banner Messages:

### Banner messages are messages displayed to users when they log in to a network device, they can be used to display important messages such as a warning, a disclaimer or a welcome message.

### Banner messages can be configured in the Global Configuration Mode of a Cisco device. Here is an example of how to configure a login banner in a Cisco device:

#### Random_Router_name# configure terminal 

#### Random_Router_name(config)# banner login # Enter message. End with the character '#'. This is a login banner message.

#### Random_Router_name(config)# end


## Configuration files:

### 1. **startup-config files: It contains all the commands used by to configure the device upon startup or reboot. It is stored in non-volatile memory NVRAM of the device. When the device is shut down or restarted, the configuration in startup-config file is loaded into the device's running configuration, which is stored in the device's RAM 

### **2. running-config files: It is a config file that is stored in a device's RAM. This file contains the current configuration of the device, which can be changed by the user. When changes are made to the config of the device, the changes are stored into the running config file until the device is shut down or restarted. At that point, the Running config is copied to the Startup config file in NVRAM.

#### To view both the files, you must enter Privileged exec mode, commands to view the configuration files: 

> show startup-config
> show running-config

#### To alter configuration:

#### The "reload" command in Cisco's CLI restarts the device. This command is typically executed in Privileged Exec mode and is used to reboot the device and load the configuration from the Startup Config file stored in non-volatile memory (NVRAM).

#### The "reload" command can be useful when you need to restart the device to apply configuration changes, update software, or resolve a system issue. It should be used with caution, as it can cause an interruption in network services and result in lost data if the device is not properly configured. Before executing the "reload" command, it is a best practice to save any changes to the Running Config file to the Startup Config file using the "copy running-config startup-config" command, so that the configuration is not lost after the device reboots.

#### The "erase startup-config" command in Cisco's CLI is used to erase the configuration stored in the Startup Config file in non-volatile memory (NVRAM). This command is typically executed in Privileged Exec mode.

#### The Startup Config file contains the configuration settings that are applied to the device each time it starts or reboots. If you erase the Startup Config file, the device will no longer have a configuration and will revert to its default settings. This can be useful in cases where you want to erase all previous configuration settings and start from scratch, or when you are troubleshooting a configuration issue and want to revert to a known-good configuration.

## Configuring IP Address:

### IP Address is the primary means for devices to locate one another and establish end-to-end connection. Here's how to configure IP of a Windows device:

![[configure IP in windows device.png]]

## **Switch Interface Configuration:

![[configure swithc.png]]

## Verifying connectivity of a network device:

### To verify connectivity of a Switch Interface:

>show ip interface brief

#### The output shows the name of each interface, its IP address, the method used to assign the IP address, and the current status of the interface (up or down). This information can be used to quickly identify any issues or misconfigurations with the interfaces on the device.

### To test end-to-end connectivity in a network:

>ping `<destination-ip-address>`


#### The output of the command will show the results of the ping, including the number of packets sent, the number of packets received, the round-trip time for each packet, and any packets that were lost. If the device can successfully reach the destination device, the output should show that all packets were received. If there are any connectivity issues, the output will show a percentage of packets that were lost.
