## Types of threats:

### Someone gaining unauthorized access to an organization's network costly network outages and loss of work. Attacks on networks may cause loss of money and time, and risk of confidential information or assets falling into wrong hands. 

### Intruders can gain access to a network by:
#### 1. Software attacks 
#### 2. Hardware attacks
#### 3. By guessing username and password

### Intruders who gain access to a network by modifying software or exploiting software vulnerabilities are called threat actors.

### Here are the types of threat an intruder can pose:

#### 1. Information Threat: Intruder can break into a network and steal confidential information. That information can be used and sold for a lot of purposes for e.g. asking ransom money in return for not leaking it to competitors or public or for using stolen source code to make your own application. 

#### 2. Data loss and manipulation: Intruder/threat actor can break into a network and delete important data or manipulate information like price of an item or adding their information to employee database in order to intrude the organization. 

#### 3. Identity theft: Intruder/threat actor can break into a network and steals someone's personal information. Using that personal information they can obtain legal documents, apply for threat, make unauthorized online purchases.

#### 4. Disruption of service: Intruder can prevent legitimate users from using an online service if they gain access to it. A threat actor can also attack servers, network device by DoS attack which can be carried out in various ways, one of which is sending more traffic to the server than it can handle, it is called Buffer overflow attack, and it is one of the most common DoS attack a threat actor can carry out. 

## Types of Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerabilities refers to the degree of weakness in a network or a device which can compromise the network and all the end devices on it. There's always some degree of vulnerability involved with servers, network devices and even security devices like firewall. It is up to the user or organization to take necessary steps to secure them. Usually, network devices under attack are the end points, i.e. servers or personal computers. Different kinds of Vulnerabilities can lead to various different kinds of attacks that can be carried out on an end device. Vulnerabilities can be divided into three types:

### Technological Vulnerabilities:

#### 1. TCP/IP Protocol Weakness: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), all of these protocols used to transfer data over the internet are highly vulnerable to security threats like Sniffing (eavesdropping and collecting private data), spoofing (impersonating a device by manipulating its IP address, making it difficult to identify the source of the attack) Man-in-middle attack (threat actor can intercept the data in between and manipulate it to their own liking), DoS attacks etc. All of these attacks can be prevented by using measures like encryption like SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/TSL (Transport Layer Security) for web traffic, using firewalls, by implementing network segmentation i.e. dividing network into smaller subnetworks hence limiting the impact of an attack, keeping network security software programs up to date with latest security patches, intrusion detection by monitoring the network.

#### 2. Operating System Weakness: Each operating system like Linux, Unix and Windows have security issues. Although newer versions of these operating systems come with built-in measures to deal with various security threats, but it is up to the user to ensure that these stay enabled, and the operating system is kept up to date in order to keep up with new malware, viruses and ransomware being created to attack the operating systems.

#### 3.  Network Equipment: All types of network devices such as routers, switches and firewalls have vulnerabilities, that must be recognized and protected against. Some of these weaknesses involve Firewall holes, lack of authentication,  routing information protocol spoofing(Attackers can inject false routing information into the network, leading to routing loops and network outages.), weak passwords etc. 

## Configuration Vulnerabilities:

#### 1. Unsecured user account: If the username and password information is transferred over the network without taking any measures to secure it, it can easily be intercepted by threat actors and used by unauthorized actors for malicious activities.

#### 2. System accounts with easily guessed passwords: Poorly created system passwords can easily be guessed, which can also lead to unauthorized access to the device.

#### 3. Misconfigured internet services: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into an unsecured web page, causing them to steal sensitive data that you might enter. Misconfigured terminals that lack proper authorization and encryption can easily be hacked to gain confidential information like usernames and passwords.

#### 4. Unsecured default settings within products: Many products like network devices used in organizations or homes come with a default setting that is the same for all the devices. By not changing the default settings like default username and password, a user can easily make themselves or the organization prone to security risks like unauthorized access.

#### ** 5. Misconfigured network equipment:: Misconfiguration, like not using encryption to encrypt passwords etc. can also cause security issues in network devices


## Policy Vulnerabilities:

#### 1. Lack of written policy: A security policy, if not written down, cannot be applied or enforced.

#### 2. Politics: Political battles and turf wars can make it difficult to implement a consistent security policy, hence it makes sense to be as objective as possible when it comes to enforcing security policies.

#### 3. Lack of authentication continuity: Poorly chosen, easily cracked, or default passwords can allow unauthorized access to a network.

#### 4. Logical access controls not applied: Inadequate monitoring of network threats and security risks and policies can cause threat actors to keep harming the network undetected and hence waste company resources or even legal actions against IT company and/or employees that let these conditions persist.

#### 5. Software and hardware installation and changes not following policy: Unauthorized changes to the network topology or installation of unapproved applications on end devices that are connected to an organization's network can cause security risks in the network.

#### 6. Disaster recovery plan is nonexistent: The lack of disaster recovery plans in the view of a natural disaster or a threat actor attacking a network can lead to confusion and chaos and risk a network's security.

## Physical Security

#### 1. Hardware threats: This includes physical damage to network devices like servers, routers, switches, workstations or an entire data center in general.

#### 2. Environmental threats: This includes temperature extremes due to unregulated environments or humidity extremes due to lack of air flow controls, both of which can lead to hardware damages.

#### 3. Electrical threats: This includes voltage spikes, insufficient power supply, both of which can cause hardware damage. Other electrical threat can be power blackouts, can cause halting of operations

#### 4. Maintenance threats: This includes poor handling of key electrical components like power damaged supply wires which can cause electrostatic discharge and damage hardware othe maintenance threats include lack of spare parts which can cause halt in operations in the view of a failure, poor labeling which can cause trouble during troubleshooting in case of any fault.
