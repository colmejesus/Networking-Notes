### Protocol is a set of rules that decide how devices or systems communicate with each other in a network. In computer networking, protocols specify the method of sending and receiving data, the format of  the data, and error detection methods. Adherence to established network protocols ensure a reliable and secure network. 

## What is protocol suit?

### Protocol suits are a set of standards used for communication between networked devices. One example of a protocol suite is TCP/IP protocol, TCP stands for (Transmission Control Protocol) which is used for breaking down and re assembling data into tiny data packets which makes it easier for end devices to transmit data over a network whereas IP protocol is used for uniquely identifying end devices which help with transmitting data to the devices it was intended for. Together, these two protocols are used to transfer data across the internet, reliably. 

### By grouping protocols together, it makes it easier for developers to make networked applications and for network admins to manage the network. The protocol suites are designed to complement each other and provide a complete solution for communication.

### Protocols are viewed in terms of layers, each layer in a network is responsible for facilitating efficient communication by making sure that the standards established for the communication are being upheld i.e. all the rules set for the communication to take place in a reliable & efficient manner are being followed by end devices engaging in the communication. 

## Evolution Of Protocol suites:

### Evolution of protocol suites has followed the evolution and development of computer networking technology. The earliest protocol suite was used by ARPANET, which was developed in the late 1960s, this protocol suit included the protocols for fie transfer, e-mail and remote login.

### IP (Internet Protocol) was developed in the 1980s, which has now become the standard for the Internet. The IP protocol suite included TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which helped with reliable and efficient transmission of data between end devices in a network. 

### In the late 1990s WWW (World Wide Web) was developed which led to the development of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), which is used for the transmission of web pages over the internet. Additionally, security protocols like SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) which helped with encryption, decryption of data and allows for authentication of end devices on a network. 

### In recent years, many other protocols, both open and proprietary, have been developed. Here's a few of them:

#### Open Standards:

##### Open standard refer to openly available specification for technology, such as file formats, internet protocols, data interchange formats, that are developed and maintained by standard organizations. They are open in the sense that anyone can use, implement and develop them without paying a licensing fee or facing any restrictions.

##### Due to no licensing fee, many companies use open standards to develop hardware and software, which also ensures in operability between devices of different companies while also providing a plain level field for competition, as all companies have the access to the same technology to develop products and services based on the same standards. Here are two biggest open standards used in network technologies:

##### 1. TCP/IP: This protocol is an open standard maintained by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which is used for communication over the internet. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides a reliable way of transmitting data over the internet by establishing a virtual connection between two devices and ensuring that the data is transmitted in the right order. 

##### IP protocol is responsible for routing that data from any source to its destination. It does that by using a unique number to identify end devices called IP address, and it then routes the data packets to the destination with the help of that address. 
   
##### TCP/IP protocol uses a layered architecture, which is a modular approach to designing and implementing a complex system that facilitates the communication between end devices. The layers are organized into four main categories:
   
##### 1. Application Layer: It is the top most layer, and it provides the interface between the end user and the network by handling user's request. Application layer handles tasks like transferring files transfer (File Transfer Protocol), serving web pages (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), sending and receiving e-mails (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) using the protocols mentioned in brackets alongside each task I just mentioned.

##### 2. Transport Layer: Provide end-to-end communication services between end devices, it includes protocols like TCP and UDP to provide reliable and secure communication. 

##### 3. Internet Layer: This layer provides routing and addressing service, the main protocol in this layer is IP (Internet Protocol) which provides the mechanism for routing data packets from one device to another, it also defines the format of an IP address which is a unique number used to identify end devices.

##### 4. Link Layer: It is the bottom layer in the TCP/IP protocol suite which provides a physical connection between devices. It provides services like error detection, flow control `(mechanism that help detect if the end device the data is being sent to can handle the flow of data i.e. it is not dropping data packets, when this happens the reciever can use this mechanism to send a signal to the sender to tell it to slow down)`, Media Access Control (MAC) addressing `(technique used by link layer to uniquely identify Network Interface Cards or Wi-Fi cards)`. Ethernet is a popular technology at Link Layer used to transmit data over a network, Wi-Fi is another popular technology used to do the same but with the use of electromagnetic waves as a medium, making it wireless.

#### 2. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection): This protocol suite is a reference model for standardized communication between end devices. It was developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the 1980s as a way to standardize communication between different types of computers systems. 
#### The OSI model defines 7 layers of communication, each of which perform a specific task to facilitate reliable and secure communication between end devices. Here are the 7 layers:
##### 1.  Physical layer: This layer defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications for transmitting data over the network.
 
##### 2.  Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data over the physical layer, including error detection, flow control, and media access control (MAC) addressing.
 
##### 3.  Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks and for dividing data into smaller units for transmission.
 
##### 4.  Transport layer: This layer provides reliable end-to-end communication and ensures that data is transmitted in the correct order.
 
##### 5.  Session layer: This layer manages the establishment and termination of communication sessions between applications.
 
##### 6.  Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption, and for converting data into a format that can be understood by the application layer.

##### 7.  Application layer: This layer provides the interface between the applications and the lower layers of the protocol suite


#### Although OSI model is still an important reference model to understand how transfer of data and communication in general work between computers, but TCP/IP protocol suite is used in today's computer systems as it is more practical compared to OSI. 

### Proprietary Protocol Suites:

#### Apple AirDrop: It is a proprietary protocol suite developed by Apple in 2011 to enable easy file sharing between Apple devices. It uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to establish peer-to-peer connection between devices, once connection is established it uses 'Wi-Fi Direct' (A technology that lets two Wi-Fi enabled devices to transfer files without going through an access point or a router) to transfer the files between the devices. 


## Standard Organizations that develop and research on these open protocols and standards are non-profit, vendor neutral organizations established to promote the concept of open standards to ensure interoperability between devices that will help in easing the communication in general.
