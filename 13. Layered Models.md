## Network systems are complex with many hardware and software components like:

### End devices: Computers, Laptops, Mobiles, Smart Devices etc

### Intermediary Devices: Switches, Routers, Firewalls etc.

### Media: Wired media (Copper, Fiber Optic), Wireless media (Electromagnetic waves, microwave)

### Applications: Email Client, Web Browser (Provide human interface to interact with services)

### Protocols: Set of rules to facilitate reliable and secure communication between devices.

### Services: They are the unit of work performed by one software component to provide a specific function to another component. Think of  them as function or sub-functions. They follow protocols (rules) to prepare data for the network. They are provided by applications, operating systems, libraries and other software component. 

# Why is Layered Model Used (Benefits)

## The layered architecture helps in providing modularity to this complex system of network technologies so that it can be easily managed. It helps in the management of a system because it divides the entire system, we discussed above, into small, manageable components. It helps simplify the design and implementation of this system.

## Furthermore, it is due to each of these layers being a separate component, ensures the fact that if there is any fault in any of the component, it can be easily pinpointed and fixed by the eligible person. 

## Each layer of the layered architecture corresponds to a specific aspect of the system such as data formatting, data transmission, encryption etc. 

## Modularity also enables the ease in management because when changes are made to one layer, it doesn't affect other layers.

## Layered model also provides ease of understanding by simplifying the design and hence making the implementation of networked system, easier.

## Layered model also prevents the technology or capability changing in one layer of the system to affect other layers. 

## And since the most layer architecture implemented by networked system are based on open standards and not proprietary standard it encourages competition between hardware and software developers since products from different vendors can work with each other i.e. I can use CISCO's router with a network interface card manufactured by any other manufacturer, and they will work together, therefore CISCO or any other company cannot have monopoly over a network technology, which is healthy for competition as it lets other companies strive. 

#### Layers in OSI and TCP/IP models

# Protocol Stack:

## It is a collection of communication protocols that are organized in a hierarchical manner. Each protocol in a stack performs a particular function and provides services to the layer above it. 

## The protocols in a protocol stack work together to provide end-to-end communication between different devices in a network. i.e. HTTP protocol uses TCP service to transfer data which uses IP to identify the end device at the destination. 

## The protocols in the protocol stack are designed to be modular so that they can be easily added, removed, updated without any problem, changes to one layer does not affect another layer and modularity also makes it easy to trouble shoot faults in a specific layer. 

## Internet Protocol Stack:

### Internet Protocol Stack or TCP/IP protocol uses a layered architecture, which is a modular approach to designing and implementing a complex system that facilitates the communication between end devices. The layers are organized into four main categories:
   
##### 1. Application Layer: It is the top most layer, and it provides the interface between the end user and the network by handling user's request. Application layer handles tasks like transferring files transfer (File Transfer Protocol), serving web pages (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), sending and receiving e-mails (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) using the protocols mentioned in brackets alongside each task I just mentioned.

##### 2. Transport Layer: Provide end-to-end communication services between end devices, it includes protocols like TCP and UDP to provide reliable and secure communication. 

##### 3. Internet Layer: This layer provides routing and addressing service, the main protocol in this layer is IP (Internet Protocol) which provides the mechanism for routing data packets from one device to another, it also defines the format of an IP address which is a unique number used to identify end devices.

##### 4. Data Link Layer/Network Access Layer: It is the bottom layer in the TCP/IP protocol suite which provides a physical connection between devices. It provides services like error detection, flow control `(mechanism that help detect if the end device the data is being sent to can handle the flow of data i.e. it is not dropping data packets, when this happens the reciever can use this mechanism to send a signal to the sender to tell it to slow down)`, Media Access Control (MAC) addressing `(technique used by link layer to uniquely identify Network Interface Cards or Wi-Fi cards)`. Ethernet is a popular technology at Link Layer used to transmit data over a network, Wi-Fi is another popular technology used to do the same but with the use of electromagnetic waves as a medium, making it wireless. 

## OSI Reference Model:

### This protocol suite is a reference model for standardized communication between end devices. It was developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the 1980s as a way to standardize communication between different types of computers systems. 

### The OSI model defines 7 layers of communication, each of which perform a specific task to facilitate reliable and secure communication between end devices. Here are the 7 layers:

##### 1.  Physical layer: This layer defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications for transmitting data over the network.
 
##### 2.  Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data over the physical layer, including error detection, flow control, and media access control (MAC) addressing.
 
##### 3.  Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks and for dividing data into smaller units for transmission.
 
##### 4.  Transport layer: This layer provides reliable end-to-end communication and ensures that data is transmitted in the correct order.
 
##### 5.  Session layer: This layer manages the establishment and termination of communication sessions between applications.
 
##### 6.  Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption, and for converting data into a format that can be understood by the application layer.

##### 7.  Application layer: This layer provides the interface between the applications and the lower layers of the protocol suite


## Encapsulation in TCP/IP model:

### It is a process in which protocol add their information to the data they received from the previous layer.

## Protocol data unit at each layer has a different name to reflect its new functions, i.e. At Application Layer protocol data unit is simply called data but as soon as it moves to the Transport layer it is now known as 'Segment'. When a segment is passed to the next layer, called the Network layer, it is called 'Packet'. When packets are passed on to the next layer, Data Link Layer, they are known as 'Frames' and frames are finally passed on to the final layer which transmits the data to another end device the protocol data unit is known as 'Bits'.

## Sending a message using TCP/IP protocol:

## Receiving a message using TCP/IP protocol:

### De-Encapsulation refers to the removal of the information that was added as the data was passed on to each layer at the senders side, therefore at the receivers side the information is removed step by step as the data passes through all the layers and is finally received as it was intended for the application layers, which acts as an interface between the user and the end device.
