## Addresses in TCP/IP model

## There are 4 kinds of addresses in TCP/IP model:

IP Address: IP addresses are unique address given to an end device on a network which helps in it to connect to a network and communicate with another similar device for e.g. Computers, mobile phones, routers and modems, printers, Network-Attached Storage etc. are all end devices with their unique IP addressed within the same network. It is possible for two different networks to have a device with the same IP address. This is because IP addresses are only unique within a single network, not globally. Each network can have its own range of IP addresses, and as long as two devices have different IP addresses within their own network, there is no conflict.

MAC Address: Media Access Control address, refers to the unique address given to a Network Interface which helps in connecting end devices to the network via network media (Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi). MAC addresses are used to ensure that the data is transmitted to the correct device in a network by uniquely identifying an end device.

Port Number: Port numbers are needed to allow multiple applications on an end device to share the same IP. Without port numbers, it would be difficult to identify which application should receive the data transmitted to an IP address. In TCP/IP model, certain port number are reserved for specific applications. These are known as application-specific addresses. Here are some of them:

1. Port 80: Reserved for HTTP, web browsing application.
2. Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) Reserved for remote access
3. Port 25: Reserved for SMTP, for email transmission. 

Domain name: Is a human-readable address that is used to refer to a website or other resources on the internet, since remembering of IP address, MAC address and port number can be difficult. Domain addresses are resolved to their corresponding IP address using a service called DNS (Domain Name System).


Encapsulation of Data at Each Layer of TCP/IP model:

Encapsulation in context of networking is adding some extra information to the data that is being encapsulated. 

Encapsulation occurs from the sender's side, each layer adds information to the data that eventually helps with its transmission.

1. Application Layer: The application layer is responsible for the encoding of data, in our case let's consider we are sending an email. The application layer will encode the email into a format that can be transmitted over the network. This might include encoding the text, sender's email address and receiver email address and any attachment the email might have. This information is then passed on to the next layer.
2. Transport Layer: This layer receives the encoded email and breaks it down into smaller chunks of data called 'Packets' adding additional  information to each packet, such as the sequence numbers, to ensure data can be reassembled correctly at receiver's end. If the data is being transmitted using TCP protocol, the layer will divide the data into multiple small TCP segments.
3. Network Layer: This layer is responsible for routing the data between networks. It does this by adding the source and destination IP addresses to each packet. The IP header is used to route the packets from the senders device to the receivers device over the internet.
4. Data Link Layer: Data Link layer divides the data into even smaller units called frames and adds the data link header and trailer to each frame. The data link header includes the source and destination MAC addresses, which are used to transmit data between devices over the same network. However, when data is being transmitted between networks, the MAC address is not used. Instead, the network layer uses the IP address to route the data between networks. The IP address provides a logical addressing scheme that is used to identify devices on the internet, whereas the MAC address provides a physical addressing scheme that is used to identify devices on a LAN.
5. Physical Layer: The physical layer is responsible for transmitting the data over the physical network. It does that by encoding the data into electrical signals, light pulses or electromagnetic waves,, depending upon the medium of transmission. Physical layer also performs timing and synchronization i.e. end devices keep track of the right timing and right order for data to be transmitted effectively and efficiently between devices, if not maintained data might lose its integrity. For example let's consider audio and video streaming, if the timing between the sender and receiver is not accurate, the audio or video may become out of sync or choppy. 

## Network Addresses:

### Both Network layer and Data Link Layer use addressing to help transmit data from source to Destination.

1. Network layer adds source and destination IP address, is responsible for delivering the IP packet from source to destination end device. 
2. Data link layer source and destination for addressed ()MAC addresses) responsible for delivering the data link frame from source network interface (NIC) to the destination network interface (NIC) of the end device. MAC address is used to transmit data to an end device on the same network.

## Layer 3 Logical Address: IP Address:

Layer 3 (Network/Internet Layer) is responsible for encapsulating segment (data) with IP address of source and destination end devices. 

1. Source IP address: The address of the sender of transmission.
2. Destination IP address: The address of the receiver of transmission.

The addresses may or may not be on the same network.

IPv4 vs iPv6: 

IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of Internet Protocol used to route packets of data over the Internet.

1. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4.3 billion unique addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.
2.  Header format: The header format of IPv4 is simple and has a fixed size, while the header format of IPv6 is more complex and extensible.

The IP address contains two part:

The first three octets of IP address indicates the network portion/network address (it is called 'Prefix' in the iPv6)

And the final octet of the IP address indicate the host address (also called Interface ID in iv4) that identifies a specific the device in a network.

An example of an IPv4 address is 192.168.0.1. In this address, the first three octets (192.168.0) make up the network ID, and the final octet (1) is the host ID.

Octets are groups of 8 bits in computing and networking. An IP address is represented as a series of 4 octets in IPv4, where each octet represents 8 bits of the address, allowing for a total of 32 bits to represent the address.


## Data transfer in the Same network:

![Data Transfer in the same network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124640512/218208480-c92d0967-dd43-4ca3-b88c-01c2ab6469e5.png)

### Here, in this example, the:  

### Source = PC 1 
### Destination = FTP Server

#### 1. Application Layer: The data gets encoded on this layer, and it moves to the Transport Layer.

#### 2. Transport Layer: The data gets broken down in to small chunks called segments, either using the TCP or UDP protocol, and it passes on to the Network/Internet Layer.

#### 3. Network/Internet Layer: On this layer, source and destination IP address gets added to IP packet header to The Data segment forming Data Packets, and then the layer initiates ARP (Application Routing Protocol) which broadcasts the destination IP address to all the nodes in the network and gets a ping back when the Destination MAC address corresponding to the Destination IP address is found, the data packet is then passed on to the next layer.

#### 4. Data link: This layer maps the MAC address found by the ARP initiated in the previous layer to the Destination IP address and source IP to the source MAC address and form a Data Link Frame. The Data Link Frame is then passed on to the final layer for transmission. 

#### 5. Physical Layer: This layers encodes the data link frame in suitable format, referred to as Bits, to transmit over cables as an electrical signal or optical signal or as electromagnetic waves if the medium is wireless. This layer is also responsible for receiving the signal and transforming the bits back to the original format, and then passing it on to the layer above it for a process called De-capsulation.

#### During De-capsulation process the information pertaining to the data received is read by the layer it was intended for i.e. data link layer read and confirms the MAC address and deleted the header file that contains it and passes it on to the network layer, which does the same for IP address and then the data gets passed on to the Transport layer which reassembles the data segments and passes it on to the application layer which turns the encoded data back into it's original, readable format and reads the port number and passes it onto the application the data was intended for, in our case it was the FTP application and finally the application receives the data and presents it to the user it was intended for.

## Data transfer in the Remote network:

#### 1. Application Layer: The data gets encoded on this layer, and it moves to the Transport Layer.

#### 2. Transport Layer: The data gets broken down in to small chunks called segments, either using the TCP or UDP protocol, adds the sequence numbers to the segment for helping in their reassembly later at receiver's end, and it passes on to the Network/Internet Layer.

#### 3. Network Layer: At this layer the source and destination IP addresses are added to the data segments alongside the IP address of the 'Default Gateway' which is a device (typically a router) that acts as a bridge between local network and other network forming the data packets which are then passed on to the next layer for further encapsulation 

#### 4. Data-Link Layer: This layer adds the source MAC address and the MAC address of the Default Gateway into the header section of the data packets forming Data Frames. There is no ARP broadcast taking place at this layer, as the network we are trying to send this data to is a remote network. After this, the data frames are passed on to the next layer.

#### 5. Physical Layer: The data frames are encoded into bits, which can be encoded as an electrical signal or optical signal if the medium is wired or as electromagnetic waves if the medium is wireless. 

##### 6. Routing: This data is then transmitted to the Default Gateway (Router) which performs a lookup in its ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache or broadcast an ARP request to determine the MAC address of the destination device. Once the MAC address is obtained, the default gateway will update the data link header with the destination MAC address and forward the packet to the next hop towards the destination.
