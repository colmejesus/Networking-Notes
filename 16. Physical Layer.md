## Purpose Of Physical Layer:

### A physical connection is required to establish a connection between an end device and a network. The connection can be wired or wireless, depending upon the setup of the network. A Network Interface Card is required to connect a device to a network, a device can have more than two NIC for e.g. modern computers come with the capability of using both wired and wireless medium to connect to a network, therefore they come with more than one NIC to establish those connections.

### Not all physical connections offer the same performance, i.e. wired connections using Ethernet or fiber optic cables are much faster compared to wireless connections (Wi-Fi).

### Physical connection send the data across a medium as encoded bits of data. 

### Physical layer is responsible for transporting bits across the network through a network medium. Physical Layer is the Layer 1 in both OSI and TCP/IP models.

### The physical layer accepts the data link frames from the Data Link Layers, the layer above it also known as Layer 2 and encodes it as series of signals that are then transmitted to another network device using the network media. 

### The next device in the path de-encapsulates the received bits to make sense of the encoded data.

### The encoding of data is the last step in the encapsulation process.

## Physical Layer Standards:

## The physical layer standards i.e. what encoding methods to use, what hardware components are best for data transmission and what signaling and error correction methods are best suited for data transmissions and research regarding all of these aspects are governed by many organizations including:

### 1. ISO
### 2. EIA/TIA
### 3. ITU-T
### 4. ANSI
### 5. IEEE

### Physical Layer composed of three functional aspects:

#### 1. Physical Components: These are the hardware devices, media and other connectors that transmit and receive bits as signals. Hardware devices like NIC, cable materials and cable designs are all specified in the standards associate with the physical layer, established by the organizations mentioned above.

#### 2. Encoding: It is the process of converting a stream of data bits into a 'predefined' code. The code can be in the form of electrical current, light pulses or electromagnetic waves of a specific frequency, these are intercepted and decoded back into digital bits by the network device it was transmitted to and passed onto other layers for de-encapsulation process.

### This coding provides predictable patterns that can be recognized by the other network devices in the network, as mentioned above.

### There are many encoding methods specified by the standard organization. One of them is called Manchester method of encoding. This method of encoding uses changes in voltage at a specific time to represent bits that are being transmitted. The transition in the voltage that reflect the changes occur at the middle of the bit period i.e. the period between the passing of signals for each bit that is being transmitted over the medium for e.g. if a single bit is transmitted every one microsecond the transition of the voltage that is supposed to represent bits in the signal will occur at the middle of that period i.e. 0.5 microsecond, i.e. the voltage will change every 0.5 microsecond to represent the next bit in terms of voltage. 

Here's a pictorial representation of how Manchester method of encoding works:

#### 3. Signaling: Method of representing the bits '1' and '0' over a physical medium. Signaling methods change based on the type of physical method used. There are three types of media that are used in signaling of bits:

1. Copper: In copper cables, bits are transmitted as electrical signals over a copper wire.
2. Fiber Optic: In fiber optic cable, bits are transmitted as light pulses over a fiber optic cable.
3. Wireless: In a wireless medium, bits are transmitted as microwave signals, wirelessly over the air.

## Physical Layer Characteristics:

### Physical layer is responsible for the speed of data transmission over a medium. Bandwidth is the capacity at which a medium can carry the data over a medium, bandwidth measures the amount of data flow in BPS (Bits Per Second)

### The properties of a physical media, laws of physics and the current technologies available play a role in determining the bandwidth of a network.

## Bandwidth Terminology:

### Terms used to measure the quality of bandwidth include:

#### 1. Latency: The amount of time, including the delays, it takes for data to travel from one device to another.

#### 2. Throughput: Measure of transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.

#### 3. Traffic overhead: It is the additional data that is generated and transmitted during a network communication. This data serves a variety of purposes, such as error correction, routing information, flow control etc. This data adds on to the total amount of data that is transmitted over a network.

### 4. Goodput: The measure of 'usable' data transferred over a given period of time. Goodput = Throughput - Traffic overhead.
