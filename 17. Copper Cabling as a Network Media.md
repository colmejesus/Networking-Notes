Copper cabling is the most common type of cabling used in networks these days. It is inexpensive, easy to install and low resistance to electrical current flow i.e. electricity flows easily through it, All of these properties make it an excellent choice as a network media.

There are three types of copper cabling:

1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable
2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) cable 
3. Coaxial cable

Characteristics of the Copper Cables:

## Limitations: 

1. Attenuation: Is the property that describes the facts that longer the electrical signal has to travel through a cable, the weaker it gets
![[copper cable limitation atttenuation.png]]
2. Interference issue: The Electrical signal is susceptible to interference from two sources which can distort and corrupt the data signals, these two interferences are:

> Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
> Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)

3. Crosstalk: Crosstalk is also a form of interference in which signals in one cable induce EMI in another adjacent cable.

## Mitigation/Reducing the Limitations:

Attenuation can be mitigated by strict adherence to the length of cable used, which will not allow the signal to get weaker due to travel distance. 

Crosstalk and other kinds of Interference can be mitigated by twisting cables together, metallic shielding and grounding. It can be further mitigated by twisting the wires having opposing polarity, i.e. the wire in which electrical current flows in the opposite direction, together, the EMI generated in one wire will get cancelled out by the other wire having the opposing polarity.

## UTP Cabling:

UTP cables are terminated using RJ-45 connectors. UTP cables are mainly used to interconnect hots and intermediary device. The main characteristics of UTP cabling are:

1. The outer Jacket protects the copper wire from physical damage
2. The Twisted pair of wires protect from cross-talk as mentioned above.
3. Plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other.
4. Color coding makes each pair of wire easily identifiable


## STP Cabling:

![[STP Cablins .png]]

1. These cables are better at noise protection (interference that corrupts data) compared to UDP.
2. More expensive than UDP
3. Harder to install.
4. Terminated using the same RJ-45 connectors.
5. Connects Intermediary devices with hosts.
6. Used in commercial installations
7. Also very useful in extremely cold environments


## Characteristics of STP Cabling:

![[outer jacket in stp cables 1.png]]
### 1. The outer jacket protects copper wires from physical damage.

### 2. Braided foil shield provide better EMI/RFI protection.

### 3. Foil shield for each pair of wires provide additional EMI/RFI protection.

### 4. Color coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other. 

## Coaxial Cabling:

### Commonly used in following situations:

1. Wireless Installation: Connecting antennas to wireless devices.
2. Used by cable TV companiesÂ **to connect their satellite antenna facilities to customer homes and businesses**.
### Consists of following:

![[coaxial cabling.png]]
#### 1. Outer cable jacket to prevent physical damage.

#### 2. Woven copper braid, or metallic foil, acts as the second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor.

#### 3. A layer of flexible plastic insulation.

#### 4. A copper conductor used to transmit an electrical signal.

## Properties Of UTP Cabling:

### 1. UTP has 4 pairs of color coded copper wires twisted together.  

#### 2. The copper wires are encased in a flexible plastic sheath, no shielding is used. 

#### UTP relies on the following countermeasures to limit crosstalk:

#### 1. Each wire is paired with another wire which has opposite polarity, i.e. the current in each twisted pair flows in the opposite direction which cancels out any EMI/RMI. 

#### 2. There is variation in the twist per foot in each pair of wire, which also helps prevent crosstalk.



## UTP Cabling Standards:

Standards for UTP are established by TIA/EIA. They standardize elements like:

1. Cable type
2. Cable Length
3. Testing Methods
4. Connectors, Cable Termination

The TIA/EIA-568 standards also describe wire color codes to pin assignments, for Ethernet cables, i.e. which color wire will go in which pin of RJ-45 connector.

### IEEE Standards for Cabling:

#### There are different types of UTP cables categorized based on the bandwidth rates, for example Category 5 (1000 Mbps), Category 5e (1000 Mbps) for data transmission, Category 6 supports 10 GBps.

## UTP Connectors:

### UTP Cable is usually terminated with an RJ-45 connector. RJ-45 connector is the male component, and it has to be properly crimped at the end of the cable:

## Types of UTP Cables

1. Straight Through cable: Both the end of the cables should follow the same standard of cable to pin assignment. It is used to connect different types devices for e.g. Host (Laptop/PC) to switch, switch to router.

2. Cross-over cables: In cross-over cable one end is T568A standard and the other end is T568B standard, i.e. cable to pin assignment in different at both ends. It is used to connect similar types of devices for e.g. Host to Host, Switch to Switch, Router to Router.
