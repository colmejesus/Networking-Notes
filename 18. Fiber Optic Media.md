## There are two type of Fiber-Optic Cables:

### Single-Mode Fiber (SMF): Has a small core (9 micron) allows only one mode of light to propagate, resulting in longer transmission distance and lower signal attenuation compared to multimode. Single-mode is used in long-haul, high-speed, high-capacity applications such as being used by ISPs. It uses expensive lasers and does not have dispersion problem, i.e. light does not spread over time during transmission, dispersion causes increased loss of signal strength which in turn causes the data to get corrupt. 

### Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF): Has larger core (50-62.5 micron), allows for multiple modes of light to propagate resulting in shorter maximum distance of transmission, offers, but higher bandwidth compared to single-mode fiber optic cables of up to 10 Gbps over 550 meters.  Used in short distance, high bandwidth applications such as Data centers. It uses less expensive LEDs but has dispersion problems, that's why used over shorter distances.

## Properties Of Fiber Optic Cables:

### 1. Not as common as UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables due to being more expensive.

### 2. Transmits data over longer distances and at higher bandwidth compared to any other network media. 

### 3. Less susceptible to attenuation compared to other media.

### 4. Made of flexible, extremely thin strands of very pure glass. 

### 5. Uses laser or LED to transmit encoded bits as pulses of light.


## Uses of Fiber Optic Cables:

### Enterprise Networks: Used for backbone cabling application `[i.e.  cabling that provide interconnection between equipment rooms, telecommunication rooms etc.]` and interconnecting infrastructure devices in data centers and organizations in general.

### Fiber-To-Home (FTTH): Used to provide always on broadband services to small businesses.

### Long-Haul Networks: Used by service provider to connect countries or cities. 

### Submarine Cable Networks: Used to provide high-speed, high-capacity solutions capable of surviving in harsh underwater distances at huge transoceanic distances, i.e. crossing oceans from one continent to the other.  

## Fiber Optic Connectors:

## A fiber optic connector terminated the end of a fiber optic cable and help connecting it with an end device. There are many types of fiber optic connectors, here's of the well known ones:

### Subscriber Connector (SC): Used in telecommunication and data communication networks, widely adopted LAN and WAN connector

### Lucent Connectors (LC): a small form factor connector that is used in high density application where a lot of data is being transmitted between infrastructure devices, typically used in data centers.

## Fiber Patch Cords: 

### These are the fiber optic cables required for connecting infrastructure devices. A yellow jacket is for single-mode fiber cables, used for long distance applications and orange jacket is for multimode cables used for short distance applications.

## Fiber VS Copper:

### Fiber optic is used for backbone cabling for high-traffic application such as data centers, it is used for point to point connections i.e. connection between two devices or systems without any use of network device and for the interconnection of infrastructure present across organization buildings. Here's a comparison between copper and fiber optic media:

# Wireless Media:

### Wireless media encode bit stream as electromagnetic waves using radio or microwave frequencies, it provides access to greater mobility compared to other wired media. 

### It is the primary way users connect to home and enterprise networks, and we've seen a rapid increase in wireless-enabled media in the last decade due to its greater mobility. 

## Limitations:

### Coverage area: The coverage is of wireless media can be significantly impacted by the physical characteristics of the location it is deployed in i.e. if there are too many walls in between the signal gets weaker, the range is not very good compared to what you can get from a wired connection over a long cable and the wireless signal gets weaker as you move further away from the wireless access points transmitting the signal to end device, compared to wired media which has much more range comparatively. 

### Interference: It is prone to interference and can be easily disrupted by many common devices like microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, other Wi-Fi networks, cordless phones that operate on 2.4 GHz frequency band.

### Security: Since wireless media does not use physical component like wired media, its transmission can easily be intercepted by people

### Shared medium: Many users using the same WLAN simultaneously can result in decreased bandwidth as these devices operate on Half-Duplex, i.e. only one device can send or receive transmission at a time

## Wireless Standards:

### The IEEE and telecommunication industry standards for wireless data communications cover both Physical and data link layer. In each of these standards, physical layer dictates:

### 1. Antenna design and construction
### 2. Frequency and power of transmission
### 3. Signal reception and decoding requirements
### 4. Methods for encoding data (bits) to the radio signal.



## Types of Wireless Media:

### Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology

### Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15): Wireless Personal Area Network

### WiMAX (IEEE 802.16): Uses a point to multipoint topology to provide broadband wireless access

### Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4): Low data-rate, low power-consuming connections, generally used in IoT (Internet Of Things) applications.

### Cellular communication: 4G and 5G is widely used for broadband access.

### Satellite Communication: Costlier, researched for emergency uses or to provide network connection to places inaccessible by wired media. 

## Wireless LAN (WLAN):

### WLAN requires the following devices:

#### 1. Wireless Access Point (AP): It connects to the network using wired media and extends the network wirelessly to devices with wireless NIC cards. 

#### 2. Wireless NIC adapters: Network Interface Cards that let end devices connect to a network using wireless media.
