### A number system is a way to represent numbers using symbols, such as digits.

### There are several different types of number systems:

#### Decimal number system: This is the most commonly used number system in daily life. It uses ten symbols (0-9) to represent numbers.

#### Binary number system: This number system uses only two symbols (0 and 1) to represent numbers. It is used in computer systems and electronics.

### Octal number system: This number system uses eight symbols (0-7) to represent numbers. It is used in some computer systems.

### Hexadecimal number system: This number system uses sixteen symbols (0-9 and A-F) to represent numbers. It is also used in computer systems and electronics.

### Each number system has a specific base, which determines the number of symbols used to represent numbers. The decimal number system has a base of 10, the binary number system has a base of 2, the octal number system has a base of 8, and the hexadecimal number system has a base of 16.

## Binary and IP addresses:

### Host, servers and Network devices use binary addressing. Each address consists of a string of 32 bits, divided into 4 sections called 'Octets'. 

### Each Octet Consist of 8 Bits (or 1 Byte) separated by a dot.

## Decimal Positional Notation:

### In a Decimal system, a digit may represent a different value depending on the 'position' the digit occupies in the sequence of numbers.

### Decimal Positional Notation is a way to represent numbers using the decimal number system. It is also called the Base-10 positional notation.

### In the decimal system, each digit in a number represents a value that is a multiple of a power of 10. The rightmost digit represents the units place, the second digit from the right represents the tens place, the third digit represents the hundreds place, and so on.

### For example, consider the number 5,432. The number can be represented as 5 x 1000 + 4 x 100 + 3 x 10 + 2 x 1. Each digit represents a place value that is a power of 10. The digit 5 represents 5 x 1000, the digit 4 represents 4 x 100, the digit 3 represents 3 x 10, and the digit 2 represents 2 x 1.

## The radix of a number system is the number of symbols used in that system to represent numbers. It is also known as the base of the number system.

## Binary Positional Notation: 

## Binary Positional Notation (also known as base-2 positional notation) is a method for representing numbers using only two digits, 0 and 1. In binary positional notation, each digit in a binary number is assigned a place value starting from the rightmost digit and moving left, with the rightmost digit having a place value of 2^0, the second digit from the right having a place value of 2^1, and so on.

### For example, the binary number 1101 represents the decimal number 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 in decimal.

### To convert a binary number to a decimal number using positional notation, we use the following steps:

#### 1.  Write down the binary number and assign each digit a place value starting from the rightmost digit and moving left. The place value for the rightmost digit is 2^0, for the second digit from the right it is 2^1, for the third digit it is 2^2, and so on.
    
#### 2.  Multiply each digit of the binary number by its corresponding place value, and add all the products.
    
#### 3.  The sum obtained is the decimal equivalent of the binary number.
    

#### For example, consider the binary number 1101. The place values for each digit would be:

#### 1.  The rightmost digit (1) is assigned a place value of 2^0 = 1.
#### 2.  The next digit (1) is assigned a place value of 2^1 = 2.
#### 3.  The next digit (0) is assigned a place value of 2^2 = 4.
#### 4.  The leftmost digit (1) is assigned a place value of 2^3 = 8.

#### To find the decimal equivalent, we multiply each digit by its corresponding place value, and add the products: 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 8 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 11. Hence, the decimal equivalent of 1101 using positional notation is 11.

## How to convert a decimal IP address to binary:

An IP address is typically represented as a 32-bit number in binary form. To convert a decimal IP address to binary, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Split the decimal IP address into its individual octets.
2. Divide each decimal number (octet) by 2.
3. Repeat step 1 and 2 until the decimal number is equal to 0.
4. Read the remainders from bottom to top to obtain the binary equivalent of the decimal number.
5.  Repeat steps 1 to 4 for each octet of the IP address.
6.  Concatenate the binary representations of the octets to get the binary representation of the entire IP address.

### Here's an example of converting the decimal IP address `192.168.1.1` to binary:

#### 1.  Convert the first octet `192` to binary:

```sql
192 / 2 = 96 remainder 0
 96 / 2 = 48 remainder 0
 48 / 2 = 24 remainder 0
 24 / 2 = 12 remainder 0
 12 / 2 = 6  remainder 0
  6 / 2 = 3  remainder 0
  3 / 2 = 1  remainder 1
  1 / 2 = 0  remainder 1

Binary equivalent of 192: 11000000
```

#### 2.  Convert the second octet `168` to binary:

```sql
168 / 2 = 84 remainder 0
 84 / 2 = 42 remainder 0
 42 / 2 = 21 remainder 0
 21 / 2 = 10 remainder 1
 10 / 2 = 5  remainder 0
  5 / 2 = 2  remainder 1
  2 / 2 = 1  remainder 0
  1 / 2 = 0  remainder 1

Binary equivalent of 168: 10101000

```

#### 3.  Convert the third octet `1` to binary:

```sql
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

Binary equivalent of 1: 00000001
```

#### 4.  Convert the fourth octet `1` to binary:

```sql
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

Binary equivalent of 1: 00000001
```

### The binary equivalent of the decimal IP address `192.168.1.1` is `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`.

## Use of Hexadecimal in Networkig:

### The hexadecimal number system is a number system that uses 16 symbols (Base 16 System) to represent numbers, namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. 

### In networking, hexadecimal is commonly used to represent IP addresses, subnet masks, and MAC addresses. These values are often easier to read and manage when represented in hexadecimal form, as opposed to binary form as converting between binary and hexadecimal is easier than converting between binary and decimal, so using hexadecimal helps simplify some of the underlying computations involved in networking.

##  Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion:

### To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, you can use the following method:

#### 1.  Divide the decimal number by 16 to get the first digit of the hexadecimal representation.
#### 2.  Repeat the division process until the quotient becomes 0.
#### 3.  Write down the remainders in reverse order to get the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number.

### Here's an example of converting the decimal number `245` to hexadecimal:

#### 1.  Divide the decimal number by 16 and note the quotient and the remainder. In this case, `245/16 = 15 with a remainder of 5`.
    
#### 2.  Repeat this process with the quotient until the quotient is 0. In this case, `15/16 = 0 with a remainder of 15`.
    
#### 3.  Write down the remainders in reverse order to get the hexadecimal representation. In this case, the remainders are `5` and `15`.
    
#### 4.  Convert the remainder `15` to its hexadecimal equivalent,, character `F`.
    

#### So the final answer is `0xF5` in hexadecimal.

## Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

### To convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, we need to use the positional notation concept. Each digit in the hexadecimal number represents a power of 16, starting with the rightmost digit, which represents 16^0 (or 1), and the next digit representing 16^1 (or 16), then 16^2 (or 256), and so on.

### To convert the hexadecimal number to decimal, we simply multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 16 and add all the results.

### For example, let's convert the hexadecimal number "AF" to decimal.

### Starting from the rightmost digit:

### -   The first digit "F" represents 15 in decimal.
### -   The second digit "A" represents 10 in decimal.

### Therefore, to convert the hexadecimal number "AF" to decimal, we simply multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 16 and add the results:

### AF = 10 * 16^1 + 15 * 16^0 = 160 + 15 = 175.

### So the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number "AF" is 175.
