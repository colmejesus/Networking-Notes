## Purpose of Data Link Layer:

### The Data Link layer(OSI Model) or The Network Access Layer (TCP/IP Model) has multiple purposes. It ensures the reliable transmission of data between nodes (host/end devices) over a link (the communication channels used for transmitting data) by doing error detection and flow control (Controlling how much data is being transmitted to keep the network decongested and to make sure bandwidth is not being wasted if the other device data is being transmitted to is not able to keep up with the pace), it is also responsible for breaking the data down into manageable chunks called 'Frames', it also handles Media Access Control (MAC) which is a protocol which lets an end device control when to transmit the data frame in order to deal with collisions in a network and ensure reliable and efficient connection. 

### The layers above the Data link layer are media independent. 

### The data link layer has both Hardware and Software components, and it is dependent on the type of Network, i.e. a network which runs on fiber optic media would require data link layer to process the transmitted differently since the data is being encoded as light compared to other mediums in which it is encoded as electrical signal (Ethernet) or electromagnetic waves (Wi-Fi)

### Data link layer prepares the data for transmission to another node through a physical network. 

 
### PDU: A Protocol Data Unit is a term that is used to describe the data that is being transmitted over a network. In communication, the data is often divided into smaller chunks before being transmitted over a network to ensure the reliable and efficient transmission of data, these smaller units of Data are called PDU's. The size and the format of a PDU changes at each layer for e.g. at layer 2 i.e. Data Link Layer a PDU is called a frame, which includes Header and Trailer that contains information such as error detection code, source and Destination MAC addresses etc. At network layer (OSI) or (Internet Layer) the PDU is referred to as a 'Packet' which includes a 'Header' and a Payload, the header has the Source and Destination IP address of the data being transmitted, and the payload contains the data being transmitted. 

## Data Link Services:

### The PDU in the Data Link Layer/Layer 2 is the Data Frames and Internet Layer/Network Layer/Layer 3 is Packet.

### The data link layer encapsulates the data packet into a layer 2 data frames by adding a header and a trailer containing information such as error detection code, source and Destination MAC addresses etc.

### The MAC addresses in the header of a data link frame allows a node to identify the source and destination link. MAC addresses changes from Hop-Hop, but the IP addresses remain the same. 

### The data link services like Flow Control and Error Detection ensure reliable delivery by controlling the rate of transmission and using redundant data sent along with the frame to enable error detection caused by signal attenuation so that helps receiver detect the presence of errors and drop frames enabling sender to retransmit the dropped frames or the receiver can identify the error without resorting to getting data re-transmitted, respectfully. 

### Half Duplex Communication: This sort of communication only allows one device to send or receive data over a shared medium, it is used on WLANs and Legacy BUS topologies with Ethernet hubs

### Full Duplex Communication: Allows multiple devices to send and receive data over a shared medium.

## Data Link Standards:

### Data Link Protocols are defined by various Open Standard organizations:

#### 1. Institute For Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)

#### 2. International Telecommunications Union (ITU)

#### 3. International Standardization Organization (ISO)

#### 4. American National Standard Institute (ANSI)

## Data Link Layer Sublayer:

### The Data Link consists of two sublayers:

#### 1. Logical Link Control (LLC) : It is responsible for communicating between the networking software at the above layer and the device hardware at the lower layer, it is the sublayer that implements the Flow control and Error correction mechanisms discussed earlier, it provides communication channel between Data Link Layer and Network/Internet Layer.

### Media Access Control (MAC): This sublayer is responsible for data encapsulation (processing and adding more information like source and destination MAC addresses to the data packets it received from layer 3/Internet/Network layer) and media access control (ensuring reliable connection by controlling when a node gets to transmit data to avoid collision)

### Data Frames transferred using different link protocols over different links

### At each Hop along the path, a router performs four basic Layer 2 functions:

#### 1. It accepts the frame from the network medium.

#### 2. De-encapsulates the frame to expose the encapsulated data packet, explores the IP addresses, selects the best path to send it on.

#### 3. Add the MAC address of the next hop and re-encapsulate it.

#### 4. Forwards the frame to the next hop. 


## Data link layer is implemented in the adapter known as NIC (Network Interface Card) which attaches to system buses to transfer the received data from data link layer to the layers above it.

## Role of Adapter in Communication:

### Sender's side:

#### 1. Encapsulating the packet.

#### 2. Adding the error checking bit, 

#### 3. MAC sublayer doing operations to avoid collisions, flow control.

### Receivers Side:

#### 1. De-encapsulating the data frame to expose the packet.

#### 2. Error checking 

#### 3. Passing on the packet to the upper layers.
