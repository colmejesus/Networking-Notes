## What is the need for a multiple access protocol?

### Multiple Access Protocols are needed in a network because they allow multiple end devices to use the same network medium or channel to communicate with each other efficiently.

### As in a communication network, multiple devices may need to transmit data simultaneously, and the communication resources may not be able to accommodate all the transmission all at once and this may lead to network congestion, delays, error in transmitting data.

### Multiple Access Protocols are used to manage the simultaneous transmission of data by multiple devices using the same network resources in a way that does not cause any issues with the transmission. Different Multiple Access Protocols have different algorithms for determining which device can transmit the data at any given point and for managing the flow of data between devices. Multiple Access Protocols are fully decentralized algorithms, all working in sync over a network, without the need of a special node to manage the transmission.

## Multiple Access Protocol: Taxonomy 

### Multiple Access Protocol Algorithms are divided in three broad classes: 

#### 1. Channel Partitioning Algorithms: These kinds of algorithms divide the channel into smaller parts based on frequencies or co-ordinate their transmission in sync to a fixed time slot or divide the usage in terms of giving each node a unique code, used to encode the message.

### Random Access Protocols: These types of algorithms, instead of dividing the network like the previous algorithm, allow collisions and focus on recovering from those collisions.

### "Taking turns": This kind of algorithm transmit data by taking turns by passing a token, the node with the token is the only one allowed to transmit data. 

## Channel Partitioning MAC Protocols: 

#### FDMA (Frequency Division Media Access Protocol)

#### In this algorithm, each end device in the network is assigned a unique fixed frequency band. This way, multiple devices can simultaneously transmit data by only transmitting data in their assigned frequency, allowing them to transmit data simultaneously without interfering with each other.

#### TDMA (Time Division Media Access Protocol)

##### TDMA divides the channel into fixed time slots, i.e. it assigns different time slots to different devices in order to let them communicate efficiently. 

##### Imagine that you have a group of 5 friends who want to use a single walkie-talkie to communicate with each other. With TDMA, each friend would take turns using the walkie-talkie for a set amount of time. For example, the first friend might have the first time slot and be able to talk for 10 seconds, the second friend might have the second time slot and be able to talk for 10 seconds, and so on.

##### By dividing the channel into fixed time slots, TDMA algorithm allows multiple devices to use the same channel to communicate with each other efficiently. A clock can be used to synchronize this operation across end devices in some implementations of this algorithm.

Both of these channel partitioning protocols discussed above are good for sharing the channel efficiently at high loads, but very inefficient at low loads

#### Random Access Protocols

Random Access MAC Protocol allows data to be transmitted to a channel at full speed without any co-ordination between nodes. If there is a collision between two nodes sending data over shared channel, simultaneously, Random Access MAC Protocol specifies how to detect and recover from that collision, it does that in multiple ways i.e. by delayed retransmission or by collision avoidance, by checking channel before transmission. Some example of Random Access Protocol involve slotted ALOHA, ALOHA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA. 

Random partitioning protocols discussed above are bad for sharing the channel efficiently at high loads due to collision overhead, but very efficient at low loads as single nodes can fully utilize a channel's bandwidth. 

"Taking Turns" MAC protocol:

These kinds of algorithms use polling or token passing among the nodes to determine which node gets to transmit data. Polling involves a master node giving a poll to 'dumb' slave nodes to determine which node gets to transmit the data and token passing is also used as a way to transmit data in these sorts of algorithms, in which a token is passed sequentially to all the end device and the device holding the token at the moment gets to transmit the data. Both of these algorithms are bugged with latency issues and have single points of failure, i.e. if one device fails in the network, no other device will be able to communicate using the same network.
