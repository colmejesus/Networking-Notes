These sorts of algorithms are very efficient at low loads as they let a node utilize a channel's full bandwidth to transmit data, but they are quite inefficient at high load due to collision overload (excessive usage of computer memory due to performing collision detection and collision recovery). Example of algorithms using Random Access Protocols are ALOHA (Advocates of Linux Open-source Hawaii Association), slotted ALOHA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA. 

Slotted ALOHA:

Assumptions: 

1. All the data frames are of same size. 
2. Time Allotted to transmit one frame is the same for all frames. 
3. All the nodes are synchronized and only start transmission at the beginning of the allotted time slot. 
4. If two or mode nodes transmit in the same slot, all the nodes detect collision

Operations: 
When a node receives a fresh frame, it transmits it in the next slot:
- If no collision is detected, the node can send the new frame in the next slot it was assigned
- if collision is detected, the node re transmits the frame with each subsequent time slot it is assigned until it has transmitted that frame successfully, then it moves on to the next frame
Pros:
- Single active node can continuously transmit data at full bandwidth of channel.
- Highly decentralized, only time slots among the computers sending and receiving the data needs to be in sync.
- It's a very simple algorithm to implement. 
Cons:
- Collision waste time slots. 
- There can be idle slots.
- Clock synchronization needed.

Unslotted ALOHA:

Unlike ALOHA, this algorithm allows for the transmission of data at any time without proper co-ordination or synchronization between slots, This can result in reduced efficiency, as colliding packets need to be re-transmitted.

CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)

This algorithm listens to the channel to determine if any transmission between nodes is already taking place and only forwards a frame if the channel is idle, if the channel is not idle it postpones the transmission. 

Collisions can still occur due to propagation delay i.e. the time it takes for a node to listen and prepare the frame for transmission another node may be doing the same and hence a collision may occur as nodes can't detect if a transmission is about to happen, they can only detect transmissions that are already taking place. 

Distance and propagation delay play an important role in determining collision probability. 

CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection):

(d) It also senses or listens to the channel before transmitting data, but collisions can be detected in a very short moment of time using this algorithm, hence transmission about to happen can be aborted, reducing channel wastage. This algorithm easier to use in wired mediums, as signals and collisions are easy to detect in a wired medium but difficult to implement in wireless mediums. 

It is used by legacy Ethernet LANs, and it operates in Half Duplex, where only one device can send or receive transmission at a time. It uses a collision detection mechanism to govern when a device can and cannot transmit data and what happens when a collision happens when multiple devices transmit data at the same time in a shared network.

CSMA/CD Process:
- Devices transmitting data simultaneously will result in signal collision, when on a shared media. 
- This collision is then detected by the devices. 
- The collision prompts the devices to wait for a random time and retransmit the data, this part of the process keeps repeating until the frame in question is successfully transmitted.

Ethernet CSMA/CD algorithm
1. NIC receives data packet from layer 3, creates a frame.
2. NIC checks the channel, if it is idle, it transmits the data frame to its destination otherwise it waits for it to be idle. 
3. If it sends the entire data frame without detecting a collision or another transmission, it moves on to the next frame and repeats the whole process. 
4. If NIC detects another transmission, it aborts its own transmission and sends a jam signal. 
5. After aborting, NIC enters binary (exponential) backoff where it waits for a random time period before re transmitting the data, and it increases the backoff time if it once again detects a collision after re-transmission.

CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance):

This algorithm also operates in half-duplex mode and uses 'Collision avoidance' to govern when a device can and cannot transmit data in a shared network. 

CSMA/CD collision avoidance process:

- When transmitting data, devices also include time duration needed for transmission to other devices on a shared medium, making it possible for other end devices to know for how long the medium is going to be unavailable and avoid sending data transmission during that time frame, hence 'avoiding collisions'
