An Ethernet switch is a network device that allows for Full Duplex Communication within a LAN. It operates at data link layer/layer 2 and uses packet forwarding to transmit data from source to destination.

It uses CSMA/CD for collision detection while forwarding the frames in a shared medium. They are referred to as a 'transparent device' since the hosts are unaware of the presence of switches. They don't need to be configured because of self learning, which allows them to dynamically learn and store the information about the devices connected to it in its 'MAC address table' which it uses to make forwarding decision to forward the frames based on the destination MAC addresses of the incoming packets. 

Every host in the network has a dedicated direct connection to the switch, which allows for faster, more reliable, low latency and secure connection. 

Devices connected to each other via a switch can operate with experiencing collisions due to having a point-to-point direct connection with a switch which mediates the transmission for the end devices. Switches can also be connected to other switches, making a larger network of devices a possibility. 

Frame Forwarding Method on a Cisco Switches:
Switches use the following frame forwarding methods for forwarding data between nodes on a network:

1. Store and Forward Switching: In this method, a switch receives the frame, checks for errors using CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), if the CRC is valid, it looks up the destination address, which determines the routing path of the frame. After this process, the frame is forwarded out of the correct port. 

2.  Cut-through switching: In this method of switching, the network switch begins forwarding the frame as soon as it reads the destination MAC address from the packet's header, without waiting for the entire packet to be received. This method of switching leads to lower latency, however it is used in environments where lower error rate is expected as it does not perform error checking on the entire packet and any errors that occur in the latter part of the packet will not be detected. There are two variants of cut-through switching:
- Fast-Forward switching: In this method of switching the network switch begins forwarding the frame as soon as it reads the destination MAC address from the packet's header until it reaches its Maximum Transmission Unit size i.e. the maximum size of a frame or packet can be sent over the network by the physical layer, unfragmented. The MTU size is determined by the physical layer of the network and defines the maximum size of the data payload that can be carried in a single packet.
   When a packet is larger than the MTU size, it must be broken down into smaller fragments, which are then reassembled at the receiving end. After the transmission of the packet reaches MTU point, the switch performs a basic error check on the packet, if the check fails the packet is discarded.

- Fragment-free switching: In this method of switching, the network switch begins forwarding the frame as soon as it reads the destination MAC address from the packet's header until the first 64 bytes of the packet have been received, then it performs an error check on the first 64 bytes and of the packet, if the check fails the packet is discarded.

Memory Buffering on Switches:

A switch uses a buffering technique to store frames before forwarding them. It is also used when the destination port is busy due to congestion.  There are two methods of buffering:

1. Port based memory: Frames as stored in queues that are linked to the specific incoming and outgoing ports in the switch. Packets arriving at a port are stored in the memory buffers associated with that port, the switch read from the buffer to forward the packet to its destination. This method provides predictable performance for each port and ensures one port cannot consume all memory and impact performance of other ports.

2. Shared memory: In this method, the switch has a single shared memory buffer that all the ports can access. Packets arriving at any port are stored in the same shared memory buffer, and the switch reads from the shared buffer to forward the packet to its destination. In this method of memory allocation the memory is allocated dynamically to different ports offering greater flexibility in terms of memory utilization as memory allocation can adapt to changing traffic patterns. 

Duplex Mismatch:

A Duplex mismatch occur when duplex speed settings of two network devices are different, i.e. one device is configured for full duplex transmission and another is configured for half duplex transmission. This can result in problems such as dropped packets, increased collision rates and reduced overall performance.

How is Duplex mismatch resolved?

Duplex mismatch can be resolved by enabling Auto-negotiation on switches or NIC's. Auto negotiation is a feature in network devices that automatically determines the best duplex speed and flow control settings to use for communication between two devices. It enables network devices to communicate their capabilities and agree on the best settings to use, even if the devices are manufactured by different vendors or use different technologies.

When two network devices are connected, they use auto negotiation to exchange information about their duplex speed and flow control capabilities. Based on this information, the devices agree on the best settings to use for communication. Auto negotiation helps to eliminate the possibility of a duplex mismatch, which can result in communication problems, such as dropped packets and reduced overall performance

Right media selection for a network connection:

The choice of the right media for a network connection is important to ensure optimal network performance. Two common types of cables used for network connections are crossover cables and straight-through cables.

How does Auto MDIX help with the configuration of the type of cable being used in a network?

Auto MDIX (Auto Media-Dependent Interface Crossover) is a feature in network devices that automatically detects and corrects the type of cable being used for a connection. With Auto MDIX, network devices can determine whether a straight-through cable or a crossover cable is being used and adjust their connections accordingly.

Traditionally, network devices required the use of a specific type of cable, such as a crossover cable, for direct connections between two devices. However, with Auto MDIX, network devices can automatically detect and correct the type of cable being used, eliminating the need to manually configure the connections or use a specific type of cable.

Auto MDIX provides greater flexibility and ease of use in network connections, as it eliminates the need to manually configure the connections or use a specific type of cable. It also helps to reduce the possibility of human error when making connections, as the devices can automatically detect and correct the type of cable being used.

In summary, Auto MDIX is a feature in network devices that automatically detects and corrects the type of cable being used for a connection, eliminating the need to manually configure the connections or use a specific type of cable. It provides greater flexibility and ease of use in network connections and helps to reduce the possibility of human error.
