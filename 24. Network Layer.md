## Basic Functions:

### 1. Routing: It is the process of determining the path that data packets should take to reach their destination. The network layer uses routing algorithms and routing tables to do that. Routing tables store information about the network including address of other devices, cost of reaching them and number of hops. Routing algorithms are mathematical formula that estimate the best path for a data packet to take based on number of hops, bandwidth of a network, delay in the network etc. 

### 3. Forwarding: It is the process of taking an incoming data packet and forwarding it to the next hop in their journey to the destination. Network layer takes care of forwarding by examining the destination address of each packet and then transmitting it to the next device on the network, this process continues until the packet reaches the destination.

### 4. Encapsulation & De-encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of adding a header and a trailer to the data segment. The header and trailer contains information such as source and destination IP address, which is used by the network layer for routing and forwarding etc. Encapsulation happens at the source device, and the resulting packet is transmitted through the network to the destination device. De-encapsulation is the reverse of encapsulation, it is performed at the destination device, the original data is then passed on to the higher layers for further processing. 

### 5. Addressing: Process of assigning unique addresses to devices in a network. These addresses are used by the network layer to identify devices and route the data packet to the correct destination. Addresses can either be static i.e. assigned manually or Dynamic i.e. when they are assigned automatically by the network. 

### 6.  Congestion control: Congestion control is the process of controlling network traffic to prevent network bottlenecks. The network layer is responsible for monitoring network traffic and controlling the flow of data to ensure that it is transmitted efficiently. This can be done through techniques such as flow control, where the rate at which data is transmitted is adjusted based on the available bandwidth, or through techniques such as packet dropping, where data packets are discarded when the network becomes congested.
 
### 6.  Quality of Service (QoS): Quality of Service (QoS) is the process of controlling the quality of service for different types of traffic in the network. The network layer provides mechanisms for controlling the QoS for different types of traffic, such as real-time audio or video traffic, which require a high level of quality and low latency. This can be done through techniques such as traffic shaping, where the rate at which data is transmitted is adjusted based on the type of traffic, or through techniques such as priority queuing, where data packets are given priority based on their type.    

### These are the basic functions of the network layer in more detail. The network layer plays a critical role in ensuring the reliable and efficient communication of data in computer networks.

## Internet protocol Encapsulation:

### The following steps occur during IP encapsulation:

#### 1.  Data segmentation: The original data is divided into smaller segments that can be easily managed and transmitted over the network.
  
#### 2.  Adding IP header: An IP header is added to each data segment, containing information such as source and destination IP addresses, the protocol used for transmission, and the length of the data segment.

 
#### 3.  Calculating the checksum: A checksum is calculated for each data segment and IP header to ensure data integrity during transmission.


#### 4.  Encapsulating in a network layer protocol: The IP header and data segment are then encapsulated in a network layer protocol, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi, for transmission over the physical network.


#### 5.  Transmitting the packet: The encapsulated IP packet is transmitted over the network to the destination.

  
#### 6.  Decapsulating at the destination: At the destination, the IP packet is decapsulated and the original data is extracted from the IP header and data segment.

### Note that the IP address does not change from source to destination, while the MAC address does, for each link in the path. 

## Characteristics of IP protocol:

### Network Layer Protocol is required in every host, router in the path of data transfer in order to route the data efficiently to its destination. Router examines IP datagrams i.e. the frames passing through it for routing purposes. IP (Internet Protocol) is said to have low overhead because the size of the header information in each IP packet is relatively small compared to the size of the payload data. 

### IP Protocol can be described as: 

#### 1. Connectionless service: It is called a connectionless protocol because it does not establish a dedicated connection between the source and destination devices before transmitting data. Instead, each IP packet is sent individually and independently, without any prior setup or connection being established between the devices.

#### 2. Best Effort service: It is called a "best effort" service because it provides no guarantees about the delivery or reliability of data transmission. Each IP packet is transmitted independently, without any guarantees or confirmations about its delivery, and it is up to higher-layer protocols to provide reliable data transmission.

#### 3. Unreliable service: The Internet Protocol (IP) is called an unreliable service because it does not guarantee delivery of data packets. In other words, when data is transmitted over an IP network, there is no guarantee that all the packets will reach their destination, or that they will arrive in the correct order.

#### This is in contrast to other communication protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which provides a reliable, ordered delivery of data by retransmitting any lost packets and verifying that the correct order has been maintained.

#### 4. Media-Independent service: The Internet Protocol (IP) is referred to as a media-independent service because it is not tied to a specific type of physical network. IP can be used over a wide variety of communication media, including wired networks (such as Ethernet), wireless networks (such as Wi-Fi), and even satellite networks.

#### This media independence allows IP to be used in a variety of different networking environments, making it a versatile and flexible protocol. For example, IP can be used to connect computers within a local area network (LAN), or to connect remote networks over a wide area network (WAN). IP can also be used to connect devices in a home network, or to connect multiple organizations in a large enterprise network.

#### The network layer establishes the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) i.e. the largest packet size, specified in octets, that can be sent in a packet based network.
