## Host Forwarding Decisions:

#### The following is a general overview of how host forwarding decisions are taken by the network layer:

#### 1.  Packet receipt: When a packet is received by a host, the network layer checks the destination address in the packet header.
    
#### 2.  Routing table lookup: The network layer uses the destination address to look up the next hop in the host's routing table. The routing table is a database that maps destination addresses to the next hop in the network.
    
#### 3.  Forwarding decision: Based on the information in the routing table, the network layer makes a forwarding decision and determines the next hop in the network to which the packet should be sent. If the destination address is not on the same network as the host, the network layer uses the default gateway as the next hop.
    
#### 4.  Packet transmission: The network layer then transmits the packet to the next hop, either directly or by sending it to the data link layer for further processing.
    
#### 5.  Repeat: The process is repeated at each hop in the network until the packet reaches its final destination.

## Default Gateway: 

### A default gateway is a device on a network that acts as an entry point or an exit point for data packets that are destined for a network outside the local network. IT is used to forward packets from a host. 

### A default gateway is typically a router of a switch that is configured with a default route, which is a special type of routing entry that specifies the next hop for the data packets that have a destination outside a local network. When a host sends a data packet outside a network, it will always be sent to the device which acts as a default gateway of that network. The default gateway is set up on each host on the network by setting the IP address of the default gateway in the network configuration settings of a host device, this can either be done automatically or manually by any user. 

### In summary, the default gateway is a critical component of network communication, providing a gateway between networks and enabling the routing of data packets from one network to another. It is typically a router or switch that is configured with a default route, and is used to forward data packets from a host on one network to a different network when the destination address is not on the same network as the source host.

## Host Routing Tables: 

### Host routing tables are the databases that store the routes a device (computer or a router) uses to determine where to send network packets. It contains information about the available route to different network destination and preferred path to use for each destination. 

### A host routing table typically contains the following information:

#### 1.  Destination network address: This is the network address of the destination network that the route leads to.
    
#### 2.  Subnet mask: This is used to determine which portion of the destination IP address corresponds to the network address and which portion corresponds to the host address.
    
#### 3.  Next hop: This is the IP address of the next device that the packet should be sent to in order to reach the final destination.
    
#### 4.  Interface: This is the network interface through which the packet should be sent.
    
#### 5.  Metric: This is a value that represents the cost of using the route, and is used by the routing algorithm to determine the best route to use.
    

#### The host routing table is stored in the memory of the network-enabled device and is maintained by the operating system. It is present in all network-enabled devices, including computers, routers, switches, and firewalls. The routing table is constantly updated as the network changes, and is used by the device to make forwarding decisions for incoming packets.

#### Here's what a host routing table look like:

#### At the network layer, the routing table plays an important role in directing network traffic. When a device receives a packet, it looks up the destination address in its routing table to determine the best way to send the packet. The routing table is used to determine the next hop for the packet, i.e., the next device in the network that the packet should be sent to in order to reach its final destination.

#### On Windows, you can access the host routing table using the command prompt. To view the routing table, use the command "route print". This will display the contents of the routing table, including the destination network, the subnet mask, the gateway, and the metric associated with each route. You can also use the "netstat" command with the "-r" option to display the routing table.
