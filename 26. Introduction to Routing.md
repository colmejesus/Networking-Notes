## Routing VS Switching:

### Switching and Routing both techniques are used to transfer data packets between hosts in a network. However, there are some very important differences between them:

#### 1. Purpose: The main purpose of switching is to create a direct communication between two devices, allowing them to exchange data directly. The main purpose of routing, on the other hand, is to determine the best path for data to travel from its source to its destination, often across multiple networks. 
#### 2. Layer of operation: Switching operates at Data link layer or layer 2 of the OSI model, and uses source and destination MAC address in a packet to determine which host on the network to forward the packet to whereas routing operates on the Network layer, which is layer 3 of the OSI model and uses source and destination IP address to determine the best path for a data packet to take in order to reach its destination host. 
#### 3. Scalability: Switches are designed to be scalable in order to handle large number of devices within a single network. Routers are also scalable, they are typically used to connect multiple networks together, rather than to handle connections within a single network. 
#### 4. Functionality: Switches are rather simple devices, as they only need to know the MAC address of the devices on their local network. Routers, on the other hand, need to maintain a database that contains information about other networks, their topology and best paths to take in order to reach the destination address. 

## Router Packet Forwarding Decisions: 

### A router takes several decisions while forwarding a packet from one host device to the next hop. These decisions include:

#### 1.  Destination address: The first decision that a router makes is to determine the destination address of the packet. The router uses this information to determine which network the packet is destined for.
    
#### 2.  Routing table: The router then consults its routing table to determine the best path to the destination network. The routing table contains information about the available routes to different network destinations and the preferred path to use for each destination.
    
#### 3.  Next hop: Based on the information in the routing table, the router determines the next hop for the packet, i.e., the next device in the network that the packet should be sent to in order to reach its final destination.
    
#### 4.  Outgoing interface: The router then determines the outgoing interface through which the packet should be sent. This is the physical or logical connection that the router uses to send the packet to the next hop.
    
#### 5.  Encapsulation: If the packet needs to traverse different networks, the router may need to encapsulate the packet in a new network layer protocol before forwarding it. This allows the packet to be transmitted over networks that use different protocols.
    
#### 6.  Forwarding: Finally, the router forwards the packet to the next hop using the determined outgoing interface.
    

##### These decisions are made by the router in real-time, and the router updates its routing table as the network topology changes, to ensure that it continues to make the best forwarding decisions for incoming packets.

## Types of Routes present in a Routing Table:

### There are three main types of routes in a routing table:

#### 1.  Directly connected routes: These routes represent networks that are directly connected to the router. The router has a direct link to these networks and does not need to send packets to another device to reach them.
    
#### 2.  Static routes: These are routes that are manually configured by a network administrator and are not learned dynamically from other routers. Static routes are useful in situations where the network topology is known and does not change frequently.
    
#### 3.  Dynamic routes: These are routes that are learned dynamically from other routers, typically through a routing protocol such as OSPF or BGP. Dynamic routes allow the router to automatically update its routing table as the network topology changes, ensuring that it continues to have accurate information about the available paths to different networks.
    

#### Default Route: A default route is a special entry in the routing table that acts as a catch-all for packets that are destined for a network that is not explicitly listed in the routing table. The default route is also known as the default gateway and is typically represented by the notation 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 in IP networks.

#### The default route specifies the next hop for packets that are not matched by any other route in the routing table. This allows the router to forward packets to any network, even if it does not have specific information about the destination network in its routing table. The next hop specified in the default route is usually a router that provides access to a larger network, such as the Internet.

#### The default route is an important component of a routing table, as it provides a mechanism for forwarding packets to destinations that are not explicitly listed in the routing table. The default route is typically set by a network administrator and is used to connect the local network to a larger network, such as the Internet.

### In most networks, a combination of static and dynamic routes is used, with static routes being used for known, unchanging parts of the network, and dynamic routes being used for more dynamic or less well-known parts of the network.
