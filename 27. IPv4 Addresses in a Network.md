## Three types of addresses in an IPv4 Network:

### 1.  Network Address: A network address is the first address in a range of IP addresses that are assigned to a network. It is used to identify the network to which a device belongs. This address is important for routing data between networks. For example, if a device on one network wants to send data to a device on another network, it needs to know the network address of the destination network. Network addresses are typically assigned to routers, which use them to route data between networks.

### An example of a network address is 192.168.1.0, which is the network address for a network with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. In this example, the first three numbers (192.168.1) represent the network address, while the last number (0) represents the host address.

### 2.  Broadcast Address: A broadcast address is the last address in a range of IP addresses that are assigned to a network. It is used to send data to all devices on a network. When a device sends data to the broadcast address, all devices on the network receive the data. Broadcast addresses are typically used for tasks such as network discovery or distributing data to all devices on a network.

### An example of a broadcast address is 192.168.1.255, which is the broadcast address for a network with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. In this example, the first three numbers (192.168.1) represent the network address, while the last number (255) represents the broadcast address.

### 3.  Host Address: A host address is a unique address that identifies a specific device on a network. It is used to send data directly to a specific device on the network. Host addresses are typically assigned to devices such as computers, printers, and servers.

### An example of a host address is 192.168.1.10, which is the host address for a device on a network with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. In this example, the first three numbers (192.168.1) represent the network address, while the last number (10) represents the host address of the device.

#### It's important to note that the range of addresses for a network depends on the subnet mask being used. The subnet mask determines which part of an IP address represents the network address and which part represents the host address. Understanding how IP addresses are structured and how they are used can be important for network configuration and troubleshooting.

## Unicast vs Multicast vs Boradcast Addresses in a network:

### 1.  Unicast Address: An IP unicast address is an address that identifies a single device on a network. When a device sends data to a unicast address, the data is sent to only that device. This is the most common type of IP address used on a network.

### Example: 192.168.1.10 is a unicast IP address used to send data to a single device on a network.

### 2.  Multicast Address: An IP multicast address is an address that identifies a group of devices on a network. When a device sends data to a multicast address, the data is sent to all devices that have joined the multicast group. This is useful for sending data to multiple devices at once without having to send the data to each device individually.

### Example: 224.0.0.1 is a multicast address used for all hosts on a network segment. If a device sends data to this multicast address, all devices on the network segment will receive the data.

### 3.  Broadcast Address: An IP broadcast address is an address that is used to send data to all devices on a network. When a device sends data to a broadcast address, the data is sent to all devices on the network. This is useful for tasks such as network discovery or distributing data to all devices on a network.

### Example: 192.168.1.255 is a broadcast address used to send data to all devices on a network with the IP address range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. If a device sends data to this broadcast address, all devices on the network with IP addresses in that range will receive the data.
