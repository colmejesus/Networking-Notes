As defined by IEFT (Internet Engineering Task Force) IPv4 addresses are used globally to route data packets sent among hosts is any network. There are two types of IPv4 addresses:

1. Private IPv4 Addresses: They are the common block of IP addresses that can be used by most private organization or entities to assign IPv4 addresses to internal hosts in any network. These addresses are not unique and can be used internally within any network. 
 Here's the range of private IPv4 addresses that can be used to assign IPv4 addresses to any private network:

Although private addresses cannot be used to globally route data packets. NAT (Network Address Translation) is used to resolve that. In network Address Translation, private IPv4 addresses are translated by a NAT device to a public address, i.e. even though a data packet when sent through a host has private IP as source address they are assigned a public IP address that can be used to route a packet globally.

Generally a Border or Gateway router, i.e. is the network device that connects interior and exterior routers, is configured for NAT. 

Here's a pictorial representation of How NAT works:

2. Public IPv4 Addresses: They are unique 32-bit numbers assigned to hosts on a network that are accessible from the public Internet. These addresses are globally routable and can be used to communicate directly with devices on the other network, without the need of NAT. They are assigned by Internet Assigned Network Authority (IANA) to Regional Internet Registry(RIRs), who in turn assign them to the ISPs and other organizations. These addresses are used for devices such as web servers, email servers and other devices that need to be accessed globally by many devices over the public Internet, real life example are Google servers, Dropbox servers etc. Public IPv4 addresses are unique and are not used by more than once device as it would create conflicts.

## Special Use IP addresses:

1. Loopback address: A loopback address is a special address used by a host device to refer to itself, regardless of the device's actual IP address. In IPv4, the loopback address is 127.0.0.1, while in IPv6, it is represented by ::1. When a device sends a packet to a loopback address, the packet is imminently returned to the same device without being transmitted over the internet. This is often needed for testing network interfaces or for running applications locally without the need of a network connection.
2.  Link Local address: It is a special type of IP address that is used by the devices on the same network to communicate among themselves. Link-local addresses are assigned automatically by the device, typically using the IPv4 link-local address range of 169.254.0.0/16 or the IPv6 link-local address range of fe80::/64. Devices can use link-local addresses to communicate with each other without the need for a global or routable IP address, which can be useful in situations where a network infrastructure may be limited or non-existent, such as in ad-hoc wireless networks or in some types of industrial control systems.

Classful VS Classless Addressing:

Classful addressing: Classful addressing is an older approach to IP addressing that was used before the introduction of classless addressing. In classful addressing, IP addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each class has a fixed number of network bits and host bits, and each class has a range of IP addresses that can be used for addressing hosts on a network. For example, Class A addresses have 8 bits dedicated to the network portion of the address and 24 bits for the host portion, allowing for a large number of hosts on a single network.

Classless addressing: Classless addressing is a more flexible approach to IP addressing that was introduced to replace classful addressing. In classless addressing, the network portion and host portion of an IP address are not predetermined, but instead, the subnet mask is used to determine the network and host portions. This allows for greater flexibility in network design and the ability to allocate IP addresses more efficiently. Classless addressing allows for the creation of subnets, which are smaller networks within a larger network, each with its own subnet mask.

In summary, classful addressing is an older, inflexible approach to IP addressing that divides IP addresses into five classes, while classless addressing is a more flexible approach that uses subnet masks to determine the network and host portions of an IP address. Classless addressing allows for greater efficiency and flexibility in network design, and it is the approach used in modern networks today.
