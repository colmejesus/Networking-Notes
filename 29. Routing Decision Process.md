Routing Decision Process is used by the routers to determine the best Path for forwarding the data packets through a network. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the whole process:

1. Receive Packet: When a router receives a packet from a host or another router, it looks at its header to determine the destination IP address. 
2. Checking The routing Table: The router checks the routing Table to find the next hop and the best path to send that data packet towards the next hop

3. If the destination address matches with the subnet of a network in the routing Table. It is checked if the host is directly connected to the interface, i.e. if the host is a part of the same network?
4. If yes, then the ARP (Address Routing Protocol) cache with has all the mappings of IP addresses of host devices on a network and their MAC addresses is checked to find out the corresponding MAC address of the host device to which the data needs to be transmitted to is checked, and the packet is transmitted to that device on the local network. 
5. If the destination device isn't there on the local network then the data packet is encapsulated with the new destination MAC address to the next hop and sent out of the exit interface, the source and the destination IP remains the same. 
6. If the router cannot find the destination address, then the data packet is sent to the 'Gateway of Last Resort' i.e. a special route that a router uses to forward packets when there is no specific route in its routing table for the destination network. It is also known as the default gateway, and it acts as a default exit point for all traffic that is not intended for the local network.
7. If there is no gateway of last resort available, then it sends an ICMP message to the source IP address notifying about the failure.
