### Configuring an Interface includes the following commands:

```commandline
Router(config)# interface `type-and-number`
Router(config-if)# description `description text`
Router(config-if)# ip address ipv4-address subnet-mask
Router(config-if)# ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix-length
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
```

- `Description` Is used to add information about the network connected to the interface.
- The `no shutdown` command activates the interface 
- The `ip address command` followed by the IP address and subnet mask is used to assign the IP address to the interface you are configuring
- The `ipv6 address command` followed by the IPv6 address and prefix length is used to assign the IP address to the interface you are configuring.

Here are some verification commands used to display configurations of network devices and other things like routings tables, interface statistics etc.

### `show ip interfaces` command for specific Interfaces:

##### The show interfaces displays information related to the interface itself.

#### `show ip interfaces` Command:

The `show ip interface` command is handy when you want to see what are the IP Services that have been applied to the interface.

### Default gateway:

A default gateway is a network device that serves as an access point or a router for other devices on the network to connect to the Internet or another network. It is responsible for forwarding packets to the destination network when the device's IP address doesn't match any local networks.

Configuring a default gateway involves specifying the IP address of the device that will serve as the gateway for the network. Here are the steps to configure a default gateway:

1.  Open the Command Prompt: Click on the Start menu, type "cmd" in the search bar, and click on the Command Prompt app.
    
2.  Find your network adapter's name: Type "ipconfig" and press Enter. Look for your network adapter (such as "Ethernet adapter" or "Wi-Fi adapter") and note the name of the adapter.
    
3.  Configure the default gateway: Type "netsh interface ip set address `[AdapterName]` gateway=`[GatewayIPAddress]` and press Enter. Replace `[AdapterName]` with the name of your network adapter, and `[GatewayIPAddress]` with the IP address of the default gateway. For example, if your adapter name is "Ethernet" and the default gateway IP address is "192.168.1.1", type "netsh interface ip set address Ethernet gateway=192.168.1.1".
    
4.  Verify the configuration: Type "ipconfig /all" and press Enter. Look for the "Default Gateway" field to ensure that the default gateway has been configured correctly.
    

Note that you will need administrative privileges to configure the default gateway using the Command Prompt.
