### What is collision?

To understand collision domain, we first need to understand what collision is in a network.

Two data packets, when sharing the same network medium, can collide if they are transmitted by the hosts sharing the network medium at the same time. 

### What is collision domain?

Collision domain refers to a group of network devices which share the same network medium and may experience collision when they attempt to transmit the data at the same time, which results in corrupted signal and data loss.

Devices connected to a shared communication medium, such as a hub or a repeated will be considered to be a part of the same collision domain, whereas devices like switch, router will segment the network and divide the collision domain, also reducing the possibility of a collision occurring between the devices segmented by a switch or a router. Network admins often use these devices to reduce the size of a collision domain. 

## What is Broadcast Domain?

Broadcast messages are the those messages which are received by all the hosts in a network.

Broadcast domain defines a group of host devices that receive a broadcast message sent by any other host device in a network. Device in broadcast domain typically share the same network or the same subnet, using the broadcast messages to communicate with each other. To limit the size of a broadcast domain, network administrator often use layer 3 switches to divide a network into separate broadcast domains, limiting the scope of broadcast messages and reducing unnecessary traffic. Devices like hubs and repeaters do not affect the broadcast domain.
