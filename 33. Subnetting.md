Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller segments and conserve IP addresses in the process. 

By dividing a large network into smaller subnets, the number of devices on each network is reduced, which improves network performance and makes it easier for organizations and other entities to manage security by isolating each subnet of a network from other subnets, which helps prevent unauthorized access and limit the spread of malware. 

Subnetting allows for very efficient use of IP addresses by enabling organizations to allocate IP addresses based on the number of devices in each subnet, rather than allocating large blocks of addresses to each subnet.

### VLSM :
  
Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) subnetting is a technique used to create subnets of different sizes to maximize the use of IP addresses in a network. In traditional subnetting, all subnets are created with the same subnet mask, resulting in subnets with the same number of hosts, regardless of their needs.

However, with VLSM, a network administrator can divide a larger network into subnets of different sizes, which is particularly useful in large networks where some subnets require more IP addresses than others. This allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and reduces the waste of address space.

For example, instead of creating four subnets with 64 hosts each from a Class C network (with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0), VLSM allows an administrator to create a subnet with 126 hosts, two subnets with 62 hosts, and one subnet with 2 hosts, all from the same Class C network.

### FLSM: 

Before the introduction of Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) subnetting, Fixed Length Subnet Mask (FLSM) was used.

FLSM involves dividing a network into smaller subnets, each with the same fixed size. For example, if a network has 256 hosts, and each subnet can have a maximum of 64 hosts, then the network can be divided into four subnets, each with 64 hosts. In FLSM, all subnets have the same number of hosts, regardless of their needs.

FLSM was useful in the early days of networking when network topologies were relatively simple, and the number of hosts in a network was relatively small. However, as network topologies became more complex, and the number of hosts increased, FLSM became less efficient in utilizing IP address space. VLSM was introduced to address this issue and allowed network administrators to divide a larger network into subnets of different sizes, based on their requirements.


### Computing Subnet using VLSM and FLSM:


Suppose we have been allocated a Class C network address of 192.168.10.0/24 and we need to create subnets for three departments in our organization with the following requirements:

-   Sales department: 25 hosts
-   Marketing department: 15 hosts
-   Finance department: 10 hosts

We can use both FLSM and VLSM to create subnets for these departments.

**FLSM Subnetting:**

With FLSM, all subnets must have the same subnet mask and the same number of hosts. In this case, the maximum number of hosts per subnet is 30, which is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 32 (the total number of usable host addresses per Class C network).

Therefore, we can create subnets with the following subnet masks:

-   Sales department: 192.168.10.0/27 (subnet mask 255.255.255.224)
-   Marketing department: 192.168.10.32/27 (subnet mask 255.255.255.224)
-   Finance department: 192.168.10.64/27 (subnet mask 255.255.255.224)

Note that each of these subnets has 30 usable host addresses, which is more than what the Finance department requires, resulting in some wastage of IP addresses.

**VLSM Subnetting:**

With VLSM, we can create subnets with different subnet masks and different numbers of hosts, based on the requirements of each department. Here's how we can do it:

-   Sales department: 192.168.10.0/27 (subnet mask 255.255.255.224) - 30 usable host addresses
-   Marketing department: 192.168.10.32/28 (subnet mask 255.255.255.240) - 14 usable host addresses
-   Finance department: 192.168.10.48/28 (subnet mask 255.255.255.240) - 14 usable host addresses

In this case, we have used the available IP addresses more efficiently by creating subnets with the appropriate size for each department, based on their requirements.

As we can see, VLSM allows us to allocate IP addresses more efficiently by creating subnets with different sizes, whereas FLSM requires that all subnets have the same size, resulting in some wastage of IP addresses.

### VLSM VS FLSM

The main differences between Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) and Fixed Length Subnet Mask (FLSM) are as follows:

1.  **Subnet size:** FLSM creates subnets of the same fixed size, whereas VLSM creates subnets of varying sizes based on the requirements of each subnet.
    
2.  **Efficiency:** VLSM is more efficient in utilizing IP address space as it allows for subnets of different sizes, whereas FLSM may result in some wastage of IP addresses as all subnets have the same size, regardless of their needs.
    
3.  **Flexibility:** VLSM is more flexible in terms of accommodating changes in network requirements, as subnets can be created or resized based on the needs of the network. FLSM, on the other hand, is less flexible as subnets are of a fixed size and cannot be easily resized.
    
4.  **Complexity:** VLSM is more complex to implement than FLSM, as it requires careful planning and designing of the network topology to allocate IP addresses efficiently. FLSM, on the other hand, is relatively simple to implement, as all subnets have the same size.
    
5.  **Compatibility:** VLSM is supported by most modern network devices and protocols, whereas FLSM may not be compatible with some newer protocols that require subnetting with different sizes.
    

Overall, VLSM offers more efficient use of IP addresses, greater flexibility, and support for modern network devices and protocols, but it requires more planning and implementation effort compared to FLSM.
