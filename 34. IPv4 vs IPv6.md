### What is the need for IPv6 addresses?

IPv4 addresses are limited in terms of how many of them are publically available for network enabled devices i.e. there are only 4.2 billion public IPv4 addresses available for network enabled devices and since in this modern day and age where many devices are network enabled we need more than what IPv4 was able to provide in terms of unique addresses therefore an addressing scheme where more number of devices can get unique public addresses was required hence we have IPv6 addresses. 

IPv6 addresses uses 128-bit address compared to IPv4 32 bit addressing scheme, allowing for 3.4 x $10^3$$^8$ unique IP addresses, which is a lot more than what IPv4 could've provided in the first place.  

IPv6 uses hexadecimal numbers to represent the addresses, where every 4 bit is represented by a single hexadecimal digit. 

The address is divided into 8 segment of 4 hexadecimal digits. In IPv6, 'Hextet' is the unofficial term used to refer to one 16 bit segment. 

Here's what an IPv6 address looks like:

IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in upper and lower case.

### Co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:

Since there are a lot of IPv4 enabled devices we need certain mechanisms for them to IPv4 and IPv6 devices to work together in the transition period, here are some migration techniques that help with that:

1. Dual Stack: In a 'stacked' network, every device is assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 address, allowing them to communicate with other devices using either protocol. We have dual stack routers that are used to connect different networks and can route both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, allowing devices on one network to communicate with devices on another network that are using a different protocol. 
   The use of dual-stack routers also ensures that the network can continue to function even if one protocol becomes unavailable. For example, if a destination network is only available over IPv4, then devices that only support IPv4 can still communicate with it. Similarly, if a destination network is only available over IPv6, then devices that only support IPv6 can still communicate with it.
2. Tunneling: It is a technique where IPv6 packets are encapsulated inside IPv4 packets in order to be transmitted over an IPv4 network. It is often used in situations where there is no native IPv4 support on a network.
3. NAT64: It stands for Network Address Translation 64. It's a technique used in IPv6 transition scenarios to allow IPv6-only devices to communicate with IPv4-only devices. It provides a mechanism for translating between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, allowing IPv6-only devices to access resources on IPv4 networks and vice versa.

   NAT64 works by mapping IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses and vice versa. When an IPv6-only device wants to communicate with an IPv4-only device, it sends its IPv6 packets to a NAT64 gateway. The gateway then translates the IPv6 packet into an IPv4 packet and forwards it to the IPv4-only device. When the IPv4-only device sends a response, the NAT64 gateway translates the IPv4 packet back into an IPv6 packet and forwards it to the IPv6-only device.
