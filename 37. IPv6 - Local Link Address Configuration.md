### How are LLAs are configured dynamically on hosts on a network?

In IPv6, Link-Local Addresses (LLAs) are used to communicate within a local network segment, such as a LAN. LLAs are automatically configured on each IPv6-enabled interface, and are typically used for neighbor discovery, network diagnostics, and other local communication.

Dynamic LLAs are LLAs that are automatically generated by a device when it is connected to a network, without requiring manual configuration. The process of dynamically configuring an LLA involves a few key steps:

1.  Link-Local Prefix: A Link-Local Prefix (fe80::/64) is reserved for LLAs in IPv6. This prefix is used to distinguish LLAs from Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs), which are used for communication outside the local network.
    
2.  EUI-64 Interface Identifier: An EUI-64 Interface Identifier is generated by the device using its 48-bit MAC address. This identifier is then modified by inserting the hexadecimal value "FFFE" in the middle of the identifier, and flipping the seventh bit of the identifier. This creates a unique 64-bit identifier that can be used to create the LLA.
    
3.  LLA Configuration: Once the Link-Local Prefix and EUI-64 Interface Identifier are determined, they are combined to create the LLA. The resulting address is then assigned to the device's interface as its LLA.
    

The process of generating a Dynamic LLA is typically handled automatically by the device's IPv6 stack, without requiring manual intervention. In some cases, network administrators may choose to disable Dynamic LLA generation, or configure LLAs manually for specific interfaces.

Let's say we have a device with a MAC address of "00:11:22:33:44:55" that is connected to a local network segment. When the device is powered on and connected to the network, its IPv6 stack automatically generates a Link-Local Address (LLA) using the following steps:

1.  Link-Local Prefix: The device's IPv6 stack knows that LLAs use the Link-Local Prefix "fe80::/64", which is reserved for local network communication.
    
2.  EUI-64 Interface Identifier: The device's MAC address of "00:11:22:33:44:55" is used to generate an EUI-64 Interface Identifier. This involves inserting the hexadecimal value "FFFE" in the middle of the identifier, and flipping the seventh bit of the identifier. In this case, the resulting 64-bit Interface Identifier would be "0211:22FF:FE33:4455".
    
3.  LLA Configuration: The device's IPv6 stack combines the Link-Local Prefix and EUI-64 Interface Identifier to create the LLA. In this case, the resulting LLA would be "fe80::211:22ff:fe33:4455".
    

Once the LLA is generated, it is assigned to the device's interface as its source address for local network communication. Other devices on the network can use this LLA to communicate with the device within the local network segment.

Overall, the process of dynamic LLA assignment is automatic and typically requires no manual configuration or intervention on the part of the user or network administrator.
